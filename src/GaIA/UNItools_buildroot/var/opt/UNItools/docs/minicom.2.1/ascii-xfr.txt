NAME
       ascii-xfr - upload/download files using the ASCII protocol

SYNOPSIS
       ascii-xfr -s|-r [-ednv] [-l linedelay] [-c characterdelay] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Ascii-xfr Transfers files in ASCII mode. This means no flow control, no
       checksumming and no file-name negotiation. It should only  be  used  if
       the remote system doesn’t understand anything else.

       The  ASCII protocol transfers files line-by-line. The EOL (End-Of-Line)
       character is transmitted as CRLF. When receiving, the CR	 character  is
       stripped	 from  the  incoming file.  The Control-Z (ASCII 26) character
       signals End-Of-File, if option -e is specified (unless you change it to
       Cotrol-D (ASCII 4) with -d).

       Ascii-xfr  reads	 from  stdin  when receiving, and sends data on stdout
       when sending. Some form of input or output redirection to the the modem
       device is thus needed when downloading or uploading, respectively.

OPTIONS
       -s     Send a file.

       -r     Receive a file. One of -s or -r must be present.

       -e     Send  the End-Of-File character (Control-Z, ASCII 26 by default)
	      when uploading has finished.

       -d     Use the Control-D (ASCII 4) as End-Of-File character.

       -n     Do not translate CR to CRLF and vice versa.

       -v     Verbose: show tranfer statistics on the stderr output.

       -l milliseconds
	      When transmitting, pause for this delay after each line.

       -c milliseconds
	      When transmitting, pause for this delay after each character.

       file   Name of the file to send or receive. When receiving, any	exist-
	      ing file by this name will be truncated.

USAGE WITH MINICOM
       If  you want to call this program from minicom(1), start minicom and go
       to the Options menu. Select File transfer protocols.  Add the following
       lines, for example as protocols I and J.

       I  Ascii	   /usr/bin/ascii-xfr -sv   Y	U   N	Y
       J  Ascii	   /usr/bin/ascii-xfr -rv   Y	D   N	Y
