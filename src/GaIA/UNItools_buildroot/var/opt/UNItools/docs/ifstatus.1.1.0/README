1. Introduction
---------------

        IFStatus was developed for Linux users that are usually in console
mode. It is a simple, easy to use program for displaying commonly needed /
wanted statistics in real time about ingoing and outgoing traffic of multiple
network interfaces that is usually hard to find, with a simple and effecient
view.
        I have decided to write this application for a simple cause: I could
not find any console based interface monitor with simple features like 
graphical statistics.

1.1. A piece of history
-----------------------

	IFStatus is a continued work of PPPStatus and EthStatus. PPPStatus
was my first C software, then its quality is nothing good. 
I decided to rewrite it with a new philosophy: mix the support of different 
interfaces in one application, avoiding the creation of apps like LOStatus, 
SITStatus, and so on. I used C++, STL and some design patterns techniques.


1.2. Features overview
----------------------

	You will find on this software the display features described
below:

	* Multiple interface support
	* Dynamic graphic statistics
	* Conectivity check
	* Current Transfer
	* TX and RX indicators
	* Mbox e-mail check
	* IP Address
	* Online time
	* Top Bytes/s
	* Top Packets/s
	* Ingoing
	  * Bytes
	  * Packets
	  * Errors
	* Outgoing
	 * Bytes
	 * Packets
	 * Errors

1.3. Requirements
-----------------

	To build the software the following libraries are required:

* curses (at least 4.2 version)
    A CRT screen handling and optimization package.
        http://dickey.his.com/ncurses/ncurses.html

* libstdc++

2. Configuration
----------------

	The configuration for IFStatus is located at:

		~/.ifstatus/ifstatus.cfg

2.1. Configuration Options
--------------------------

	All options described on this topic is represented in cfg file 
using the following instruction:

	Option = Value

	Use the character '#' for comments.

	Example:

		# Line comment
		Option = Value    # Comment after a instruction


	PS: The options and values are *case sensitive*.

2.1.1. Interfaces
-----------------

	Use this option to add interfaces to be monitored. The separator is
comma. To add all interfaces detected on /proc/net/dev use the word ALL.

	Example:

		Interfaces = eth0, ppp0, lo, ALL

2.1.2. EmailCheck
------------------

	This option is used to check or not the mail box (mbox).
	The value should be ON to check, or OFF to turn this feature off.

	This feature checks the current user mail box. If you're running
	IFStatus as root, it will check root mbox.

	Example:

		EmailCheck = ON


2.1.3. Information
------------------

	This option is used to show or hide the interface informations.
	The value should be ON, to show or OFF to hide.

	Example;

		Information = ON

2.1.4. GraphScaleInfo
---------------------

	This option is used to show or hide the scale information beside the 
graphic.
	The value should be ON, to show or OFF to hide.	

	Example:

		GraphScaleInfo = ON

2.1.5. GraphDataSource
----------------------

	This option is used to inform the data source which should be shown.
	Use TX value for Transmited Data, RX value for Received Data or BOTH 
	value for Transmited and Received Data.

	Example:

		GraphDataSource = BOTH


2.1.6. GraphPeriod
-------------------

	This option is used to inform the period (in seconds) of the graphic. 
	The value range is 1 to 10.

	Example:

		GraphPeriod = 1


2.1.7. Help
-----------

	This option is used to show or hide the help.
	The value should be ON, to show or OFF to hide.

	Example:

		Help = OFF


3. Help to the project I would appreciate
------------------------------------------

	What if you think that IFStatus is the best text console based
interface monitor program around? What if IFStatus is the application
you'd been waiting whole of your life, and want to express your
appreciation somehow? Helping the author you help the project itself to
keep rolling. It's not something vital I require to keep on writing and
improving IFStatus, neither you have to do it. I quite enjoy making it
in my spare time, and happy of the fact there are no deadlines and
obligations from my side. It's just my hobby.

	So how you can express appreciation to the way I waste my spare 
time, so that to make me a bit more happy and satisfied by my activities?

3.1. Feedback
--------------

	You can write some feedback saying what you liked and what is missing
in the program. Also, don't be silent if you notice bugs. Just check
everything attentively and send a detailed bug-report to my e-mail.


3.2. Promoting the little program
----------------------------------

	I bet you read some computers related magazines and visit various
Linux related sites. Please don't keep silence instead of screaming out
your adoration for the little nice program. Submit it to a software site
or catalogue or/and encourage the authors of your favourite magazine to
take a look at it and possibly write about IFStatus, just contact me for
more details.

3.3. Donations
---------------

	If you're a materialist guy like me, you might want to present me
something what I can touch, put on a sandwich or into my pocket. Here it
goes.


3.3.1. Money
-------------

	The most universal way. Depending on a sum I will be able to drink one
more beer or tequila for the health of IFStatus users or buy a piece of
hardware, electronic gagdet or even the newest model of "BMW" ;)

	The on-line donations page is located at

		http://ifstatus.sourceforge.net


3.3.2. Hardware
----------------

	Since usually I write IFStatus at home, it's always nice to upgrade
the computer it's being developed with. It can increase the speed and pleasure
I get during the process.


3.3.3. Other stuff
-------------------

	Other stuff like t-shirts, souvenirs, albums or postcards with nice
views of the nature in places where you live, baseball tickets ;) are also 
welcome.


4. Thanks
---------

	Thanks to everyone which made this work possible with donations,
suggestions, knowledgment, tests, and so on.
