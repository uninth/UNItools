<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Canvas</strong> method creates a new window (given
by the $canvas argument) and makes it into a canvas widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database
to configure aspects of the canvas such as its colors and 3-D relief.
The <strong>canvas</strong> command returns its
$canvas argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named $canvas, but
$canvas's parent must exist.</p>
<p>Canvas widgets implement structured graphics.
A canvas displays any number of <em>items</em>, which may be things like
rectangles, circles, lines, and text.
Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and
<a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/callbacks.html">callbacks</a> may
be associated with items in much the same way that the <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/bind.html">bind</a>
method allows callbacks to be bound to widgets.  For example,
a particular callback may be associated with the <strong>&lt;Button-1&gt;</strong> event
so that the callback is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with
the mouse cursor over an item.
This means that items in a canvas can have behaviors defined by
the Callbacks bound to them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="display_list">DISPLAY LIST</a></h1>
<p>The items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display,
with the first item in the display list being displayed
first, followed by the next item in the list, and so on.
Items later in the display list obscure those that are
earlier in the display list and are sometimes referred to
as being <em>``on top''</em> of earlier items.
When a new item is created it is placed at the end of the
display list, on top of everything else.
Widget methods may be used to re-arrange the order of the
display list.</p>
<p>Window items are an exception to the above rules.  The underlying
window systems require them always to be drawn on top of other items.
In addition, the stacking order of window items
is not affected by any of the canvas methods; you must use
the <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Widget.html">raise</a> and <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Widget.html">lower</a> Tk widget methods instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="item_ids_and_tags">ITEM IDS AND TAGS</a></h1>
<p>Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways:
by id or by tag.
Each item has a unique identifying number which is assigned to
that item when it is created.  The id of an item never changes
and id numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a
canvas widget.</p>
<p>Each item may also have any number of <em>tags</em> associated
with it.  A tag is just a string of characters, and it may
take any form except that of an integer.
For example, ``x123'' is OK but ``123'' isn't.
The same tag may be associated with many different items.
This is commonly done to group items in various interesting
ways;  for example, all selected items might be given the
tag ``selected''.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>all</strong> is implicitly associated with every item
in the canvas;  it may be used to invoke operations on
all the items in the canvas.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>current</strong> is managed automatically by Tk;
it applies to the <em>current item</em>, which is the
topmost item whose drawn area covers the position of
the mouse cursor.
If the mouse is not in the canvas widget or is not over
an item, then no item has the <strong>current</strong> tag.</p>
<p>When specifying items in canvas methods, if the
specifier is an integer then it is assumed to refer to
the single item with that id.
If the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to
refer to all of the items in the canvas that have a tag
matching the specifier.
The symbol <em>tagOrId</em> is used below to indicate that
an argument specifies either an id that selects a single
item or a tag that selects zero or more items.</p>
<p><em>tagOrId</em> may contain a logical expressions of
tags by using operators: '&amp;&amp;', '||', '^' '!', and parenthezised
subexpressions.  For example:</p>
<p>$c-&gt;find('withtag',  '(a&amp;&amp;!b)|(!a&amp;&amp;b)');</p>
<p>or equivalently:</p>
<p>$c-&gt;find('withtag', 'a^b');</p>
<p>will find only those items with either ``a'' or ``b'' tags, but not both.</p>
<p>Some methods only operate on a single item at a
time;  if <em>tagOrId</em> is specified in a way that
names multiple items, then the normal behavior is for
the methods is to use the first (lowest) of these items in
the display list that is suitable for the method.
Exceptions are noted in the method descriptions
below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="coordinates">COORDINATES</a></h1>
<p>All coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point
numbers.
Coordinates and distances are specified in screen units,
which are floating-point numbers optionally followed
by one of several letters.
If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels.
If the letter is <strong>m</strong> then the distance is in millimeters on
the screen;  if it is <strong>c</strong> then the distance is in centimeters;
<strong>i</strong> means inches, and <strong>p</strong> means printers points (1/72 inch).
Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the screen;  larger
x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="transformations">TRANSFORMATIONS</a></h1>
<p>Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the
upper-left corner of the window containing the canvas.
It is possible to adjust the origin of the canvas
coordinate system relative to the origin of the window using the
<strong>xview</strong> and <strong>yview</strong> methods;  this is typically used
for scrolling.
Canvases do not support scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate
system relative to the window coordinate system.</p>
<p>Individual items may be moved or scaled using methods
described below, but they may not be rotated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="indices">INDICES</a></h1>
<p>Text items support the notion of an <em>index</em> for identifying
particular positions within the item.</p>
<p>Indices are used for methods such as inserting text, deleting
a range of characters, and setting the insertion cursor position.
An index may be specified in any of a number of ways, and
different types of items may support different forms for
specifying indices.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, line and polygon items support <em>index</em> for
identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of their coordinates.
Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting
a range of characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion
cursor position. An index may be specified in any of a number
of ways, and different types of items may support different forms
for specifying indices.</p>
<p>Text items support the following forms for an index;  if you
define new types of text-like items, it would be advisable to
support as many of these forms as practical.
Note that it is possible to refer to the character just after
the last one in the text item;  this is necessary for such
tasks as inserting new text at the end of the item.
Lines and Polygons don't support the insertion cursor
and the selection. Their indices are supposed to be even
always, because coordinates always appear in pairs.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_number"><em>number</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>A decimal number giving the position of the desired character
within the text item.
0 refers to the first character, 1 to the next character, and
so on. If indexes are odd for lines and polygons, they will be
automatically decremented by one.
A number less than 0 is treated as if it were zero, and a
number greater than the length of the text item is treated
as if it were equal to the length of the text item. For
polygons, numbers less than 0 or greater then the length
of the coordinate list will be adjusted by adding or substracting
the length until the result is between zero and the length,
inclusive.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_end"><strong>end</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Refers to the character or coordinate just after the last one
in the item (same as the number of characters or coordinates
in the item).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_insert"><strong>insert</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor
is drawn in this item. Not valid for lines and polygons.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_sel_2efirst"><strong>sel.first</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Refers to the first selected character in the item.
If the selection isn't in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_sel_2elast"><strong>sel.last</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Refers to the last selected character in the item.
If the selection isn't in this item then this form is illegal.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__5bx_2cy_5d"><strong>[</strong><em>x,y</em><strong>]</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given by <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are specified in the coordinate
system of the canvas.
If <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> lie outside the coordinates covered by the
text item, then they refer to the first or last character in the
line that is closest to the given point.
The Tcl string form ``@x,y'' is also allowed.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="dash_patterns">DASH PATTERNS</a></h1>
<p>Many items support the notion of an dash pattern for outlines.</p>
<p>The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element
represents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd
segments are drawn using the ``outline'' color. The other segments
are drawn transparant.</p>
<p>The second possible syntax is a character list containing only
5 possible characters <strong>[.,-_ ]</strong>. The space can be used
to enlarge the space between other line elements, and can not
occur as the first position in the string. Some examples:</p>
<pre>
 -dash .     = -dash [2,4]
 -dash -     = -dash [6,4]
 -dash -.    = -dash [6,4,2,4]
 -dash -..   = -dash [6,4,2,4,2,4]
 -dash '. '  = -dash [2,8]
 -dash ','   = -dash [4,4]</pre>
<p>The main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it
it shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash
list will be multiplied by the line width before display. This
assures that ``.'' will always be displayed as a dot and ``-''
always as a dash regardless of the line width.</p>
<p>On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash
pattern will be displayed as the most close dash pattern that
is available. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the
above examples are available. The last 2 examples will be
displayed identically as the first one.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="widget_methods">WIDGET METHODS</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Canvas</strong> method creates a widget object.
This object supports the <strong>configure</strong> and <strong>cget</strong> methods
described in <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/options.html">the Tk::options manpage</a> which can be used to enquire and
modify the options described above.
The widget also inherits all the methods provided by the generic
<a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/Widget.html">Tk::Widget</a> class.</p>
<p>The following additional methods are available for canvas widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_addtag"><em>$canvas</em>-&gt;<strong>addtag</strong>(<em>tag, searchSpec, </em>?<em>arg, arg, ...</em>?)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>For each item that meets the constraints specified by
<em>searchSpec</em> and the <em>arg</em>s, add
<em>tag</em> to the list of tags associated with the item if it
isn't already present on that list.
It is possible that no items will satisfy the constraints
given by <em>searchSpec</em> and <em>arg</em>s, in which case the
method has no effect.
This command returns an empty string as result.
<em>SearchSpec</em> and <em>arg</em>'s may take any of the following
forms:</p>
</dd>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_above_tagorid"><strong>above </strong><em>tagOrId</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects the item just after (above) the one given by <em>tagOrId</em>
in the display list.
If <em>tagOrId</em> denotes more than one item, then the last (topmost)
of these items in the display list is used.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_all"><strong>all</strong></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects all the items in the canvas.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_below_tagorid"><strong>below </strong><em>tagOrId</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects the item just before (below) the one given by <em>tagOrId</em>
in the display list.
If <em>tagOrId</em> denotes more than one item, then the first (lowest)
of these items in the display list is used.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_closest_x_y__3fhalo_3f__3fstart_3f"><strong>closest </strong><em>x y </em>?<em>halo</em>? ?<em>start</em>?</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects the item closest to the point given by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.
If more than one item is at the same closest distance (e.g. two
items overlap the point), then the top-most of these items (the
last one in the display list) is used.
If <em>halo</em> is specified, then it must be a non-negative
value.
Any item closer than <em>halo</em> to the point is considered to
overlap it.
The <em>start</em> argument may be used to step circularly through
all the closest items.
If <em>start</em> is specified, it names an item using a tag or id
(if by tag, it selects the first item in the display list with
the given tag).
Instead of selecting the topmost closest item, this form will
select the topmost closest item that is below <em>start</em> in
the display list;  if no such item exists, then the selection
behaves as if the <em>start</em> argument had not been specified.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_enclosed_x1_y1_x2_y2"><strong>enclosed</strong> <em>x1</em> <em>y1</em> <em>x2</em> <em>y2</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects all the items completely enclosed within the rectangular
region given by <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em>.
<em>X1</em> must be no greater then <em>x2</em> and <em>y1</em> must be
no greater than <em>y2</em>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_overlapping_x1_y1_x2_y2"><strong>overlapping</strong> <em>x1</em> <em>y1</em> <em>x2</em> <em>y2</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the
rectangular region given by <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>,
and <em>y2</em>.
<em>X1</em> must be no greater then <em>x2</em> and <em>y1</em> must be
no greater than <em>y2</em>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_withtag_tagorid"><strong>withtag </strong><em>tagOrId</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Selects all the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bbox"><em>$canvas</em>-&gt;<strong>bbox</strong>(<em>tagOrId, </em>?<em>tagOrId, tagOrId, ...</em>?)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Returns a list with four elements giving an approximate bounding box
for all the items named by the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments.
The list has the form ``<em>x1 y1 x2 y2</em>'' such that the drawn
areas of all the named elements are within the region bounded by
<em>x1</em> on the left, <em>x2</em> on the right, <em>y1</em> on the top,
and <em>y2</em> on the bottom.
The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by
a few pixels.
If no items match any of the <em>tagOrId</em> arguments or if the
matching items have empty bounding boxes (i.e. they have nothing
to display)
then an empty string is returned.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_bind"><em>$canvas</em>-&gt;<strong>bind</strong>(<em>tagOrId</em>?, <em>sequence</em>? ?,<em>callback</em>?)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This method associates <em>callback</em> with all the items given by
<em>tagOrId</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by
<em>sequence</em> occurs for one of the items the callback will
be invoked.
This method is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> method except that
it operates on items in a canvas rather than entire widgets.
See <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/bind.html">the Tk::bind manpage</a> for complete details
on the syntax of <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed
on <em>callback</em> before invoking it.
If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing
any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagOrId</em>
(if the first character of <em>command</em> is ``+'' then <em>command</em>
augments an existing binding rather than replacing it).
In this case the return value is an empty string.
If <em>callback</em> is omitted then the method returns the <em>callback</em>
associated with <em>tagOrId</em> and <em>sequence</em> (an error occurs
if there is no such binding).
If both <em>callback</em> and <em>sequence</em> are omitted then the method
returns a list of all the sequences for which bindings have been
defined for <em>tagOrId</em>.</p>
</dd>
<p>The only events for which bindings may be specified are those related to
the mouse and keyboard (such as <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Leave</strong>,
<strong>ButtonPress</strong>, <strong>Motion</strong>, and <strong>KeyPress</strong>) or virtual events.
The handling of events in canvases uses the current item defined
in <a href="#item_ids_and_tags">ITEM IDS AND TAGS</a> above.  <strong>Enter</strong> and <strong>Leave</strong> events trigger for an
item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the current item;
note that these events are different than <strong>Enter</strong> and <strong>Leave</strong>
events for windows.  Mouse-related events are directed to the current
item, if any.  Keyboard-related events are directed to the focus item, if
any (see the <a href="#focus">focus</a> method below for more on this).  If a
virtual event is used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the
virtual event is defined by an underlying mouse-related or
keyboard-related event.</p>
<p>It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.
This could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the
item's id and another is associated with one of the item's tags.
When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked.
A binding associated with the <strong>all</strong> tag is invoked first,
followed by one binding for each of the item's tags (in order),
followed by a binding associated with the item's id.
If there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag,
then only the most specific binding is invoked.
A <strong>continue</strong> in a callback terminates that
subroutine, and a <strong>break</strong> method terminates that subroutine
and skips any remaining callbacks for the event, just as for the
<strong>bind</strong> method.</p>
<p>If bindings have been created for a canvas window using the <strong>CanvasBind</strong>
method, then they are invoked in addition to bindings created for
the canvas's items using the <strong>bind</strong> method.
The bindings for items will be invoked before any of the bindings
for the window as a whole.</p>

a given item doesn't actually have the input focus unless (a)
its canvas is the focus window and (b) the item is the focus item

<em>Index</em> gives a textual description of the desired position
as described in <a href="#indices">INDICES</a> above.
Text items interpret <em>index</em> as an index to a  character,
line and polygon items interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).
The return value is guaranteed to lie between 0 and the number

Text items interpret <em>beforethis</em> as an index to a  character,
line and polygon items interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).
For lines and polygons the <em>string</em> must be a valid coordinate

This method is similar to the <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/option.html">cget</a> method except that
it applies to a particular item rather than the widget as a whole.
<em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>create</strong>

<p>This method is similar to the <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/option.html">configure</a> method except
that it modifies item-specific options for the items given by
<em>tagOrId</em> instead of modifying options for the overall
canvas widget.
If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for the first item given by <em>tagOrId</em>
(see <a href="../../../../../lib/site_perl/5.8.7/i686-linux-thread-multi/Tk/options.html">the Tk::options manpage</a> for
information on the format of this list).  If <em>option</em> is specified
with no <em>value</em>, then the method returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified).  If
one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the method
modifies the given widget <code>option(s)</code> to have the given <code>value(s)</code> in
each of the items given by <em>tagOrId</em>;  in
this case the method returns an empty string.
The <em>option</em>s and <em>value</em>s are the same as those permissible

in the display list just before the item given by <em>belowThis</em>.
If <em>tagOrId</em> refers to more than one item then all are moved
but the relative order of the moved items will not be changed.
<em>BelowThis</em> is a tag or id;  if it refers to more than one
item then the first (lowest) of these items in the display list is used
as the destination location for the moved items.
Note: this method has no effect on window items.  Window items always
obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window items is
determined by the <strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> methods of the widget, not the
<strong>raise</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> methods for canvases.
This method returns an empty string.</p>

<dd>
<p>Generate a Postscript representation for part or all of the canvas.
If the <strong>-file</strong> option is specified then the Postscript is written
to a file and an empty string is returned;  otherwise the Postscript
is returned as the result of the method.
If the interpreter that owns the canvas is marked as safe, the operation
will fail because safe interpreters are not allowed to write files.
If the <strong>-channel</strong> option is specified, the argument denotes the name
of a channel already opened for writing. The Postscript is written to
that channel, and the channel is left open for further writing at the end
of the operation.
The Postscript is created in Encapsulated Postscript form using
version 3.0 of the Document Structuring Conventions.
Note: by default Postscript is only generated for information that
appears in the canvas's window on the screen.  If the canvas is
freshly created it may still have its initial size of 1x1 pixel
so nothing will appear in the Postscript.  To get around this problem
either invoke the <strong>update</strong> method to wait for the canvas window
to reach its final size, or else use the <strong>-width</strong> and <strong>-height</strong>
options to specify the area of the canvas to print.
The <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> argument pairs provide additional

Each value of the hash must consist of Postscript
code to set a particular color value (e.g. ``<strong>1.0 1.0 0.0 setrgbcolor</strong>'').
When outputting color information in the Postscript, Tk checks
to see if there is a key in the hash with the same

If so, Tk uses the value of the element as the Postscript method
to set the color.
If this option hasn't been specified, or if there isn't a key

Each value of the hash must consist of an array reference with
two elements, which are the name and point size of a Postscript font.
When outputting Postscript commands for a particular font, Tk
checks to see if <em>hashRef</em> contains a value with the same
name as the font.
If there is such an element, then the font information contained in
that element is used in the Postscript.
Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what Postscript font to use.
Tk's guesses generally only work for well-known fonts such as
Times and Helvetica and Courier, and only if the X font name does not
omit any dashes up through the point size.
For example, <strong>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</strong> will work but
<strong>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</strong> will not;  Tk needs the dashes to

<h1><a name="overview_of_item_types">OVERVIEW OF ITEM TYPES</a></h1>
<p>The sections below describe the various types of items supported
by canvas widgets.  Each item type is characterized by two things:
first, the form of the <strong>create</strong> method used to create
instances of the type;  and second, a set of configuration options
for items of that type, which may be used in the
<strong>create</strong> and <strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods.
Most items don't support indexing or selection or the methods
related to them, such as <strong>index</strong> and <strong>insert</strong>.
Where items do support these facilities, it is noted explicitly
in the descriptions below.
At present, text, line and polygon items provide this support.
For lines and polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate
the coordinates of the item.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="arc_items">ARC ITEMS</a></h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>arc</strong> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions.
An arc is a section of an oval delimited by two angles (specified
by the <strong>-start</strong> and <strong>-extent</strong> options) and displayed in
one of several ways (specified by the <strong>-style</strong> option).
Arcs are created with methods of the following form:</p>
<pre>
 $canvas-&gt;createArc(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)</pre>
<p>The arguments <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>x2</em>, and <em>y2</em> give
the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a
rectangular region enclosing the oval that defines the arc.
After the coordinates there may be any number of <em>option</em>-<em>value</em>
pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options
for the item.  These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be
used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> methods to change the item's
configuration.
The following options are supported for arcs:</p>

is <strong>center</strong> then the text is centered on the point;  if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the text will be drawn such that
the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the
text will be at the positioning point.
This option defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>

<dt><strong><strong>-fill</strong> =&gt; <em>color</em></strong>

<dt><strong><strong>-activefill</strong> =&gt; <em>color</em></strong>

<dt><strong><strong>-disabledfill</strong> =&gt; <em>color</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the color to be used to fill the text in its normal, active, and
disabled states.
<em>Color</em> may have any of the forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetColor</strong>.
If <em>color</em> is undef then the text will be transparent.
If this option isn't specified then it defaults to <strong>black</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dfont__3d_3e_fontname"><strong>-font</strong> =&gt; <em>fontName</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the font to use for the text item.
<em>FontName</em> may be any string acceptable to <strong>Tk_GetFontStruct</strong>.
If this option isn't specified, it defaults to a system-dependent
font.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2djustify__3d_3e_how"><strong>-justify</strong> =&gt; <em>how</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies how to justify the text within its bounding region.
<em>How</em> must be one of the values <strong>left</strong>, <strong>right</strong>,
or <strong>center</strong>.
This option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple
lines.
If the option is omitted, it defaults to <strong>left</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-state</strong> =&gt; <em>state</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the text item where <em>state</em> may be set to one of:
normal, disabled, or hidden.  A text item may also be in the ``active''
state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can take
separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the
appearance of the item can be different in each state.</p>

<dt><strong><strong>-stipple</strong> =&gt; <em>bitmap</em></strong>

<dt><strong><strong>-activestipple</strong> =&gt; <em>bitmap</em></strong>

<dt><strong><strong>-disabledstipple</strong> =&gt; <em>bitmap</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the
the text in its normal, active and disabled states.
<em>bitmap</em> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the
forms accepted by <strong>Tk_GetBitmap</strong>.
If <em>bitmap</em> is an empty string (the default) then the text
is drawn in a solid fashion.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-tags</strong> =&gt; <em>tagList</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.
<em>TagList</em> consists of a list of tag names, which replace any
existing tags for the item.
<em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dtext__3d_3e_string"><strong>-text</strong> =&gt; <em>string</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p><em>String</em> specifies the characters to be displayed in the text item.
Newline characters cause line breaks.
The characters in the item may also be changed with the
<strong>insert</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> methods.
This option defaults to an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-updatecommand</strong> =&gt; <em>command</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time
the text item is updated on the screen.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dwidth__3d_3e_linelength"><strong>-width</strong> =&gt; <em>lineLength</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms
described in the <a href="#coordinates">COORDINATES</a> section above.
If this option is zero (the default) the text is broken into
lines only at newline characters.
However, if this option is non-zero then any line that would
be longer than <em>lineLength</em> is broken just before a space
character to make the line shorter than <em>lineLength</em>;  the
space character is treated as if it were a newline
character.</p>

<h1><a name="window_items">WINDOW ITEMS</a></h1>
<p>Items of type <strong>window</strong> cause a particular window to be displayed
at a given position on the canvas.
Window items are created with methods of the following form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>$canvas</em>-&gt;<strong>createWindow</strong>(<em>x, y</em>?, <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>, <em>-option</em>=&gt;<em>value</em>, ...?)</p>
<p>The arguments <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> specify the coordinates of a
point used to position the window on the display (see the <strong>-anchor</strong>
option below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).
After the coordinates there may be any number of <em>option-value</em>
pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options
for the item.  These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be
used in <strong>itemconfigure</strong> method to change the item's
configuration.
The following options are supported for window items:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><strong>-anchor</strong> =&gt; <em>anchorPos</em></strong>

<dd>
<p><em>AnchorPos</em> tells how to position the window relative to the
positioning point for the item;  it may have any of the forms
accepted by <strong>Tk_GetAnchor</strong>.  For example, if <em>anchorPos</em>
is <strong>center</strong> then the window is centered on the point;  if
<em>anchorPos</em> is <strong>n</strong> then the window will be drawn so that
its top center point is at the positioning point.
This option defaults to <strong>center</strong>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dheight__3d_3e_pixels"><strong>-height</strong> =&gt; <em>pixels</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the height to assign to the item's window.
<em>Pixels</em> may have any of the
forms described in the <a href="#coordinates">COORDINATES</a> section above.
If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as an empty
string, then the window is given whatever height it requests internally.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-state</strong> =&gt; <em>state</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Modifies the state of the window item where <em>state</em> may be set to one of:
normal, disabled, or hidden.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-tags</strong> =&gt; <em>tagList</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.
<em>TagList</em> consists of a list of tag names, which replace any
existing tags for the item.
<em>TagList</em> may be an empty list.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><strong>-updatecommand</strong> =&gt; <em>command</em></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time
the window item is updated on the screen.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dwidth__3d_3e_pixels"><strong>-width</strong> =&gt; <em>pixels</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the width to assign to the item's window.
<em>Pixels</em> may have any of the
forms described in the <a href="#coordinates">COORDINATES</a> section above.
If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as an empty
string, then the window is given whatever width it requests internally.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item__2dwindow__3d_3e__24widget"><strong>-window</strong> =&gt; <em>$widget</em></a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the window to associate with this item.
The window specified by $widget must either be a child of
the canvas widget or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget.
<em>PathName</em> may not refer to a top-level window.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note:  due to restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it is not
possible to draw other graphical items (such as lines and images) on top
of window items.  A window item always obscures any graphics that
overlap it, regardless of their order in the display list.</p>

<h1><a name="bindings">BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p>Canvas has default bindings to allow scrolling if necessary:
&lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;Left&gt; and &lt;Right&gt; (and their &lt;Control-*&gt; counter
parts).  Further &lt;Proir&gt;, &lt;Next&gt;, &lt;Home&gt; and &lt;End&gt;.  These
bindings allow you to navigate the same way as in other
widgets that can scroll.</p>

<h1><a name="credits">CREDITS</a></h1>
<p>Tk's canvas widget is a blatant ripoff of ideas from Joel Bartlett's
<em>ezd</em> program.  <em>Ezd</em> provides structured graphics in a Scheme
environment and preceded canvases by a year or two.  Its simple
mechanisms for placing and animating graphical objects inspired the
functions of canvases.</p>
