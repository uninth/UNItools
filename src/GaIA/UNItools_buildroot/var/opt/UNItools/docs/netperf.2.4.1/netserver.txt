NAME
       netserver - a network performance benchmark server


SYNOPSIS
       netserver [-P portnum] [-n numcpus]


DESCRIPTION
       Netserver  listens  for	connections  from  a  benchmark,  and responds
       accordingly.  It can either be run from or as a standalone daemon (with
       the -p flag). If run from the -p option should not be used.


   OPTIONS
       -h     Display a usage string, and exit.

       -n numcpus
	      Specify  the  number of CPU’s in the system on those systems for
	      which netperf has no way to find the number of CPU’s programati-
	      cally.

       -p portnum
	      Listen  on  the  specified port.	This is used when running as a
	      standalone daemon.
