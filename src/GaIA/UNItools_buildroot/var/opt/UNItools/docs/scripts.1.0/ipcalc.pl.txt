NAME
       ipcalc.pl - IP Calculator

PACKAGE
       UNItools

SYNOPSIS
       ipcalc [-n|-h|-v|-help] ADDRESS[[/]NETMASK] [NETMASK]

DESCRIPTION
       ipcalc  takes  an  IP  address and netmask and calculates the resulting
       broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range.	 By  giving  a
       second  netmask,	 you  can  design  sub-	 and supernetworks. It is also
       intended to be a teaching tool and presents  the	 results  as  easy-to-
       understand binary values.

       Enter  your  netmask(s)	in  CIDR  notation  (/25)  or  dotted decimals
       (255.255.255.0).	 Inverse netmask are recognized. If you mmit the  net-
       mask, ipcalc uses the default netmask for the class of your network.

       Look at the space between the bits of the addresses: The bits before it
       are the network part of the address, the bits after  it	are  the  host
       part.  You can see two simple facts: In a network address all host bits
       are zero, in a broadcast address they are all set.

       The class of your network is determined by its first bits.

       If your network is a private internet according to  RFC	1918  this  is
       remarked.   When displaying subnets the new bits in the network part of
       the netmask are marked in a different color.

       The wildcard is the inverse netmask as used for access control lists in
       Cisco routers. You can also enter netmasks in wildcard notation.

       Do  you	want to split your network into subnets? Enter the address and
       netmask of your original network and play with the second netmask until
       the result matches your needs.

OPTIONS
       -n     Donâ€™t display ANSI color codes

       -b     Suppress the bitwise output

       -c     Just print bit-count-mask of given address

       -h     Display results as HTML

       -help  Longer help text

       -v     Print Version
