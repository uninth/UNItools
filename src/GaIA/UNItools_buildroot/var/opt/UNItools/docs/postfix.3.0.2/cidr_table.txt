NAME
       cidr_table - format of Postfix CIDR tables

SYNOPSIS
       postmap -q "string" cidr:/etc/postfix/filename

       postmap -q - cidr:/etc/postfix/filename <inputfile

DESCRIPTION
       The  Postfix mail system uses optional lookup tables.  These tables are
       usually in dbm or db format.  Alternatively, lookup tables can be spec-
       ified in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form. In this case, each
       input is compared against a list of patterns. When a  match  is	found,
       the corresponding result is returned and the search is terminated.

       To  find	 out  what types of lookup tables your Postfix system supports
       use the "postconf -m" command.

       To test lookup tables, use the "postmap -q" command as described in the
       SYNOPSIS above.

TABLE FORMAT
       The general form of a Postfix CIDR table is:

       network_address/network_mask	result
	      When  a  search  string matches the specified network block, use
	      the corresponding result value. Specify 0.0.0.0/0 to match every
	      IPv4 address, and ::/0 to match every IPv6 address.

	      An  IPv4	network	 address  is a sequence of four decimal octets
	      separated by ".", and an IPv6 network address is a  sequence  of
	      three to eight hexadecimal octet pairs separated by ":".

	      The  network_mask	 is  the number of high-order bits in the net-
	      work_address that the search string must match.

	      Before comparisons are made, lookup keys and table  entries  are
	      converted from string to binary. Therefore table entries will be
	      matched regardless of redundant zero characters.

	      Note: address information may be enclosed inside "[]"  but  this
	      form is not required.

	      IPv6 support is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       network_address	   result
	      When  a search string matches the specified network address, use
	      the corresponding result value.

       blank lines and comments
	      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are	 lines
	      whose first non-whitespace character is a ‘#’.

       multi-line text
	      A	 logical  line	starts	with  non-whitespace text. A line that
	      starts with whitespace continues a logical line.

TABLE SEARCH ORDER
       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the  table,  until  a
       pattern is found that matches the search string.

EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP
       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
	   smtpd_client_restrictions = ... cidr:/etc/postfix/client.cidr ...

       /etc/postfix/client.cidr:
	   # Rule order matters. Put more specific whitelist entries
	   # before more general blacklist entries.
	   192.168.1.1		   OK
	   192.168.0.0/16	   REJECT
