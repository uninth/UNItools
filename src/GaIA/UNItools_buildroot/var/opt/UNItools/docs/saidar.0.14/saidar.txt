NAME
       saidar - a curses-based tool for viewing system statistics

SYNOPSIS
       saidar [-d delay] [-c] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       saidar  is a curses-based tool for viewing the system statistics avail-
       able through libstatgrab. Statistics include CPU, processes, load, mem-
       ory, swap, network I/O, disk I/O, and file system information.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported.

       -d DELAY
	      Wait DELAY seconds between updates (default 3)

       -c     Enables coloured output

       -v     Prints the version number

       -h     Display help and exits

COLOURED OUTPUT
       When  the  -c  option  is used saidar uses colours to display the data.
       Each area has a different colour to  distinguish	 it  from  the	nearby
       fields.	Bold  and  reverse  video  effects are used to emphasis fields
       where necessary.

       The load average figures are displayed in  bold	when  they’re  notably
       (greater	 that  1)  different  to  each other. This purely shows that a
       change in the load is occuring.

       When CPU usage goes over 60% it will be displayed in bold.  At 90%  the
       field  is  displayed using reverse video. Likewise for memory, swap and
       disk usage at 75% and 90%. Zombie processes are also highlighted.

       Other values (paging, disk I/O and network I/O) are not highlighted due
       to the nature of the values; it’s not easy to determine what thresholds
       are significant.
