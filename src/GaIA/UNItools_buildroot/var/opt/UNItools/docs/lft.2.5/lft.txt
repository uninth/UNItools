NAME
     lft - display the route packets take to a network host/socket; optionally
     show heuristic network information in transitu

SYNOPSIS
     lft [-d dport] [-s sport] [-m retry min] [-M retry max] [-a ahead]
	 [-c scatter ms] [-t timeout ms] [-l min ttl] [-H max ttl] [-q ISN]
	 [-D device] [-ACENRSTVehinrvz] [<gateway> <...>] target:dport

DESCRIPTION
     The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, con-
     nected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one’s packets follow (or
     finding the miscreant gateway that’s discarding your packets) can be dif-
     ficult.  (from traceroute(8))

     lft sends various TCP probes (differing from Van Jacobson’s UDP-based
     method) utilizing the IP protocol ‘time to live’ field and attempts to
     elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED (during transit) response from each gateway
     along the path to some host.  lft also listens for various TCP and ICMP
     messages along the way to assist network managers in ascertaining per-
     protocol heuristic routing information and can optionally retrieve vari-
     ous information about the networks it traverses.

     The only mandatory parameter is the target host name or IP number.
     Options toggle the display of more interesting data or change the vari-
     ables of the trace itself.	 The (-E/-e) adaptive option tries several
     combinations of TCP states (changing flags inside the probes it sends) in
     order to improve the chances of a successful trace and expose stateful
     packet filters.

     Other options are:

     -d dport
	     Set dport as the destination TCP port of the probes LFT gener-
	     ates.  Default is 80.  This option is useful to see if packets
	     follow a different route based on protocol destination, a likely
	     scenario when load balancers or proxies are involved.  This
	     option may also bypass less sophisticated packet filter configu-
	     rations.

     -s sport
	     Set sport as the origin TCP port of the probes LFT generates.
	     Default is 53.  This option is useful to see if packets follow a
	     different route based on protocol source. This option may also
	     bypass less sophisticated packet filter configurations.

     -z	     Automatically select a pseudo-random source port.	This option
	     may be useful if your local packet filter or proxy doesn’t allow
	     you to use source ports outside of the dymanic range allocation.

     -m min  Set min as the minimum number of probes to send per host.
	     Default is 1 unless adaptive (-E) mode is used.

     -M max  Set max as the maximum number of probes to send per host.
	     Default is 5.

     -a ahead
	     Set ahead as the number of hops forward to query before waiting
	     for a response.  Default is 5.

     -c scatter ms
	     Set scatter ms as the minimum number of milliseconds to wait
	     between sending probes.  Default is 20.

     -t timeout ms
	     Set timeout ms as the maximum number of milliseconds to wait
	     before assuming a probe was lost/discarded.  Default is 1000.

     -l min ttl
	     Set min tll as the minimum TTL (time-to-live) on outgoing probes
	     (essentially, the first hop in the line that you want to dis-
	     play).  Default is 1.

     -q ISN  Set ISN as the ISN (initial sequence number) of the first probe.
	     If unset, one will be automatically generated using a pseudo-ran-
	     dom, time-seeded algorithm.

     -D device
	     Set device as the network device or IP address to be used.
	     (e.g., "en1" or "1.2.3.4")	 If unset, lft will attempt to deter-
	     mine and acquire the appropriate interface based on routing.

     -H ttl  Set ttl as the maximum TTL, essentially the maximum route traver-
	     sal distance in hops.  Default is 30.

     -i	     Disable "stop" on ICMP other than TTL expired.

     -n	     Print addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numeri-
	     cally.  Disables use of the DNS resolver completely.

     -h	     Print addresses symbolically rather than symbolically and numeri-
	     cally.  If the DNS resolver fails to resolve an address, the
	     address is printed numerically.

     -E/e    Enable use of the adaptive engine which tries several combina-
	     tions of TCP states (changing flags inside the probes it sends)
	     in order to improve the chances of a successful trace.  The
	     engine also displays other useful information such as stateful
	     inspection firewalls or broken IP stacks encountered along the
	     way.

     -N	     Enable lookup and display of network names (e.g., [GNTY-NET-
	     BLK-4]).  This option queries various registries of network
	     address allocation such as ARIN, RIPE, and APNIC.

     -A	     Enable lookup and display of of AS (autonomous system) numbers
	     (e.g., [1]).  This option queries one of several whois servers
	     (see options ’C’ and ’R’) in order to ascertain the origin ASN of
	     the IP address in question.  By default, LFT uses the pWhoIs ser-
	     vice whose ASN data tends to be more accurate and more timely
	     than using the RADB as it is derived from the Internet’s global
	     routing table and multiple Tier-1 ISP perspectives.  See
	     www.pwhois.org

     -r	     Force use of the RIPE NCC RIS whois service to lookup ASNs.  This
	     is an alternative source of timely ASN-related information built
	     using the Internet’s global routing table and multiple Tier-1 ISP
	     perspectives.  See www.ripe.net/projects/ris

     -C	     Force use of the Cymru whois service to lookup ASNs.  This is an
	     alternative source of timely ASN-related information built using
	     the Internet’s global routing table and multiple Tier-1 ISP per-
	     spectives.	 See www.cymru.com

     -R	     Force use of the RADB whois service to lookup ASNs.  This tends
	     to be quick, but incomplete and usually inaccurate with regard to
	     the ’actual’ Internet routing table.  See www.radb.net

     -T	     Enable display of LFT’s execution timer.  This option places
	     timers on the trace itself and on lookups and name resolution to
	     show where LFT is spending its time, waiting on resolvers, or
	     processing trace packets.

     -S	     Suppress display of the real-time status bar.  This option makes
	     LFT show its completed trace output only, no-frills.

     -V	     Display verbose output.  Use more V’s for more info.

     -v	     Display version information, then exit(1).

     Any hosts listed after these options and before the final host/target
     will comprise the loose source route.  Since network operators have secu-
     rity concerns regarding the use of source routing, don’t expect the LSRR
     options to do anything for you in most public networks.

EXAMPLES
     A sample use and output might be:

     [edge.lax]$ lft -S 4.2.2.2

     Hop  LFT trace to vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.2):80/tcp
      1	  ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1) 0.5ms
      2	  isi-acg.ln.net (130.152.136.1) 2.3ms
      3	  isi-1-lngw2-atm.ln.net (130.152.180.21) 2.5ms
      4	  gigabitethernet5-0.lsanca1-cr3.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.249) 3.0ms
      5	  p6-0.lsanca1-cr6.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.2) 3.4ms
      6	  p6-0.lsanca2-br1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.5.49) 3.3ms
      7	  p15-0.snjpca1-br1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.5.58) 10.9ms
      8	  so-3-0-0.mtvwca1-br1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.7.33) 11.1ms
      9	  p7-0.mtvwca1-dc-dbe1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.9.166) 11.0ms
     10	  vlan40.mtvwca1-dc1-dfa1-rc1.bbnplanet.net (128.11.193.67) 11.1ms
     **	  [neglected] no reply packets received from TTLs 11 through 20
     **	  [4.2-3 BSD bug] the next gateway may errantly reply with reused TTLs
     21	  [target] vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.2) 11.2ms


     The (-S) option was used to suppress the real-time status bar for clean
     output.  LFT’s "**" notifiers in between hops 10 and 21 represent addi-
     tional useful information: the first is a "[neglected]" indicator that
     lets us know that none of the probes sent with the TTLs indicated
     elicited responses.  This could be for a variety of reasons, but the
     cause of this specific occurrence is described in the next informative
     message which indicates that this is likely the result of a bug in the
     4.[23] BSD network code (and its derivatives):  BSD 4.x (x < 3) sends an
     unreachable message using whatever TTL remains in the original datagram.
     Since, for gateways, the remaining TTL is zero, the ICMP "time exceeded"
     is guaranteed to not make it back to us.  LFT does its best to identify
     this condition rather than print lots and lots of hops that don’t exist
     (trying to reach a high enough TTL).

     Now, using the adaptive engine option:


     [edge.lax]$ lft -E -S 4.2.2.1

     Hop  LFT trace to vnsc-pri.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.1):80/tcp
      1	  ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1) 0.5/0.5ms
      2	  isi-acg.ln.net (130.152.136.1) 2.1/2.3ms
      3	  isi-1-lngw2-atm.ln.net (130.152.180.21) 2.6/7.1ms
      4	  gigabitethernet5-0.lsanca1-cr3.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.249) 6.1/3.9ms
     **	  [firewall] the next gateway may statefully inspect packets
      5	  p0-0-0.lsanca1-csr1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.10) 155.4/3.7ms
      6	  [target] vnsc-pri.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.1) 22.6/3.7/*/*/*/*/*ms


     In the scenario above, the adaptive engine was able to identify a state-
     ful, packet-inspecting firewall in the path.  Another example with more
     options:


     [edge.lax]$ lft -S -A -T -m 2 -d 80 -s 53 www.yahoo.com

     Hop  LFT trace to w9.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.71.88):80/tcp
      1	  [226] ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1)  1 ms
      2	  [226] isi-acg.ln.net (130.152.136.1)	2 ms
      3	  [226] isi-1-lngw2-atm.ln.net (130.152.180.21)	 3 ms
      4	  [1] gigether5-0.lsanca1-cr3.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.249)  3 ms
      5	  [1] p6-0.lsanca1-cr6.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.2)	 5 ms
      6	  [1] p6-0.lsanca2-br1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.5.49)  3 ms
      7	  [1] p1-0.lsanca2-cr2.bbnplanet.net (4.25.112.1)  3 ms
      8	  [16852] pos4-0.core1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net (209.0.227.57)  3 ms
      9	  [3356] so-4-0-0.mp1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net (209.247.10.193)  3 ms
     10	  [3356] so-3-0-0.mp2.SanJose1.Level3.net (64.159.1.130)  11 ms
     11	  [3356] gige10-0.ipcolo4.SanJose1.Level3.net (64.159.2.42)  11 ms
     12	  [3356] cust-int.level3.net (64.152.81.62)  52 ms
     13	  [10310] vl17.bas2.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.64.150)  53 ms
     14	  [10310] w9.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.71.88) [target]  54 ms

     LFT’s trace took 5.23 seconds.  Resolution required 3.58 seconds.


     Note the -Ar above displays ASNs using the RADB as a whois source.	 A
     better option may have been to use the -A alone or perhaps -AC.

     And why not request netblock lookups?

HISTORY
     The lft command first appeared in 1998 as ’fft’.  Renamed as a result of
     confusion with fast fourier transforms, lft stands for ’layer four
     traceroute.’
