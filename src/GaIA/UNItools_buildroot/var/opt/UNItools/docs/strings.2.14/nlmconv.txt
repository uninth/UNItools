NAME
       nlmconv - converts object code into an NLM.

SYNOPSIS
       nlmconv [-I bfdname│--input-target=bfdname]
	       [-O bfdname│--output-target=bfdname]
	       [-T headerfile│--header-file=headerfile]
	       [-d│--debug] [-l linker│--linker=linker]
	       [-h│--help] [-V│--version]
	       infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       nlmconv	converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the Net-
       Ware Loadable Module outfile, optionally	 reading  headerfile  for  NLM
       header  information.   For instructions on writing the NLM command file
       language used in header files, see the linkers section, NLMLINK in par-
       ticular,	 of  the  NLM Development and Tools Overview, which is part of
       the NLM Software Developer’s Kit (‘‘NLM SDK’’), available from  Novell,
       Inc.   nlmconv  uses  the  GNU  Binary  File Descriptor library to read
       infile;

       nlmconv can perform a link step.	 In other words,  you  can  list  more
       than one object file for input if you list them in the definitions file
       (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command line).  In
       this case, nlmconv calls the linker for you.

OPTIONS
       -I bfdname
       --input-target=bfdname
	   Object format of the input file.  nlmconv can usually determine the
	   format of a given file (so no default is necessary).

       -O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
	   Object format of the output file.  nlmconv infers the output format
	   based  on  the  input format, e.g. for a i386 input file the output
	   format is nlm32-i386.

       -T headerfile
       --header-file=headerfile
	   Reads headerfile for NLM header information.	 For  instructions  on
	   writing the NLM command file language used in header files, see see
	   the linkers section, of the NLM  Development	 and  Tools  Overview,
	   which  is  part of the NLM Software Developer’s Kit, available from
	   Novell, Inc.

       -d
       --debug
	   Displays (on standard error) the linker command line used  by  nlm-
	   conv.

       -l linker
       --linker=linker
	   Use	linker	for any linking.  linker can be an absolute or a rela-
	   tive pathname.

       -h
       --help
	   Prints a usage summary.

       -V
       --version
	   Prints the version number for nlmconv.
