NAME
       ranlib - generate index to archive.

SYNOPSIS
       ranlib [-vV] archive

DESCRIPTION
       ranlib  generates  an index to the contents of an archive and stores it
       in the archive.	The index lists each symbol defined by a member of  an
       archive that is a relocatable object file.

       You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.

       An  archive  with  such	an  index speeds up linking to the library and
       allows routines in the library to call each  other  without  regard  to
       their placement in the archive.

       The  GNU	 ranlib	 program  is another form of GNU ar; running ranlib is
       completely equivalent to executing ar -s.
