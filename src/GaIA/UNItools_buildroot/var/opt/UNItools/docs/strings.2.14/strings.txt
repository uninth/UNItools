NAME
       strings - print the strings of printable characters in files.

SYNOPSIS
       strings [-afov] [-min-len]
	       [-n min-len] [--bytes=min-len]
	       [-t radix] [--radix=radix]
	       [-e encoding] [--encoding=encoding]
	       [-] [--all] [--print-file-name]
	       [--target=bfdname]
	       [--help] [--version] file...

DESCRIPTION
       For  each  file	given,	GNU  strings  prints  the  printable character
       sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given with
       the  options  below)  and are followed by an unprintable character.  By
       default, it only prints the strings from	 the  initialized  and	loaded
       sections	 of  object  files;  for  other	 types of files, it prints the
       strings from the whole file.

       strings is mainly useful	 for  determining  the	contents  of  non-text
       files.

OPTIONS
       -a
       --all
       -   Do  not  scan  only	the  initialized and loaded sections of object
	   files; scan the whole files.

       -f
       --print-file-name
	   Print the name of the file before each string.

       --help
	   Print a summary of the program usage on  the	 standard  output  and
	   exit.

       -min-len
       -n min-len
       --bytes=min-len
	   Print  sequences of characters that are at least min-len characters
	   long, instead of the default 4.

       -o  Like -t o.  Some other versions of strings have -o act  like	 -t  d
	   instead.   Since we can not be compatible with both ways, we simply
	   chose one.

       -t radix
       --radix=radix
	   Print the offset within the file before each	 string.   The	single
	   character argument specifies the radix of the offset---o for octal,
	   x for hexadecimal, or d for decimal.

       -e encoding
       --encoding=encoding
	   Select the character encoding of the strings that are to be	found.
	   Possible  values for encoding are: s = single-7-bit-byte characters
	   (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc., default), S = single-8-bit-byte characters,
	   b  =	 16-bit	 bigendian, l = 16-bit littleendian, B = 32-bit bigen-
	   dian, L = 32-bit littleendian. Useful for  finding  wide  character
	   strings.

       --target=bfdname
	   Specify an object code format other than your system’s default for-
	   mat.

       -v
       --version
	   Print the program version number on the standard output and exit.
