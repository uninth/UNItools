NAME
       mtr - a network diagnostic tool



SYNOPSIS
       mtr	[-hvrctglsni46]	     [--help]	   [--version]	    [--report]
       [--report-cycles COUNT] [--curses] [--split] [--raw] [--no-dns] [--gtk]
       [--address IP.ADD.RE.SS]	  [--interval SECONDS]	 [--psize BYTES	 |  -p
       BYTES] HOSTNAME [PACKETSIZE]



DESCRIPTION
       mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a
       single network diagnostic tool.


       As  mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
       mtr runs on and HOSTNAME.  by sending packets with purposly  low	 TTLs.
       It  continues to send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of
       the intervening routers.	 This allows mtr to print  the	response  per-
       centage and response times of the internet route to HOSTNAME.  A sudden
       increase in packetloss or response time is often an indication of a bad
       (or simply overloaded) link.


OPTIONS
       -h

       --help
	      Print the summary of command line argument options.


       -v

       --version
	      Print the installed version of mtr.


       -r

       --report
	      This  option  puts mtr into report mode.	When in this mode, mtr
	      will run for the number of cycles specified by  the  -c  option,
	      and then print statistics and exit.

	      This  mode  is  useful  for  generating statistics about network
	      quality.	Note that each running instance	 of  mtr  generates  a
	      significant amount of network traffic.  Using mtr to measure the
	      quality of your network may result in decreased network  perfor-
	      mance.


       -c COUNT

       --report-cycles COUNT
	      Use  this	 option	 to  set the number of pings sent to determine
	      both the machines on the network and the	reliability  of	 those
	      machines.	 Each cycle lasts one second.


       -p BYTES

       --psize BYTES

       PACKETSIZE
	      These  options  or a trailing PACKETSIZE on the commandline sets
	      the packet size used for probing.	 It is in bytes	 inclusive  IP
	      and ICMP headers

       -t

       --curses
	      Use  this	 option	 to force mtr to use the curses based terminal
	      interface (if available).


       -n

       --no-dns
	      Use this option to force mtr to display numeric IP  numbers  and
	      not try to resolve the host names.


       -g

       --gtk
	      Use  this	 option	 to force mtr to use the GTK+ based X11 window
	      interface (if available).	 GTK+ must have been available on  the
	      system  when  mtr	 was built for this to work.  See the GTK+ web
	      page at  http://www.gimp.org/gtk/	 for  more  information	 about
	      GTK+.


       -s

       --split
	      Use this option to set mtr to spit out a format that is suitable
	      for a split-user interface.


       -l

       --raw
	      Use this option to tell mtr to use the raw output	 format.  This
	      format is better suited for archival of the measurement results.
	      It could be parsed to be presented into any of the other display
	      methods.


       -a IP.ADD.RE.SS

       --address IP.ADD.RE.SS
	      Use  this	 option	 to  bind outgoing packets’ socket to specific
	      interface, so that any packet will be sent through  this	inter-
	      face. NOTE that this option doesn’t apply to DNS requests (which
	      could be and could not be what you want).


       -i SECONDS

       --interval SECONDS
	      Use this option  to  specify  the	 positive  number  of  seconds
	      between  ICMP ECHO requests.  The default value for this parame-
	      ter is one second.


       -4
	      Use IPv4 only.


       -6
	      Use IPv6 only.


BUGS
       Some modern routers give a lower priority to ICMP ECHO packets than  to
       other  network traffic.	Consequently, the reliability of these routers
       reported by mtr will be significantly lower than the actual reliability
       of these routers.
