NAME
       unbound - Unbound DNS validating resolver 1.4.20.

SYNOPSIS
       unbound [-h] [-d] [-v] [-c cfgfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Unbound  is  an implementation of a DNS resolver, that does caching and
       DNSSEC validation.

       The available options are:

       -h     Show the version and commandline option help.

       -c cfgfile
              Set the config file with settings for unbound to read instead of
              reading     the     file     at     the     default    location,
              /home/unbound/etc/unbound/unbound.conf. The syntax is  described
              in unbound.conf(5).

       -d     Debug  flag,  do not fork into the background, but stay attached
              to the console. This flag will also delay writing to the logfile
              until  the  thread-spawn  time.  So  that  most config and setup
              errors appear on stderr.

       -v     Increase verbosity. If given multiple times, more information is
              logged.   This is in addition to the verbosity (if any) from the
              config file.

SEE ALSO
       unbound.conf(5), unbound-checkconf(8).
