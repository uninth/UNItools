NAME
       netperf - a network performance benchmark


SYNOPSIS
       netperf [global options] -- [test specific options]


DESCRIPTION
       Netperf	is  a benchmark that can be used to measure various aspects of
       networking performance.	Currently, its focus is on bulk data  transfer
       and  request/response  performance  using  either  TCP  or UDP, and the
       Berkeley Sockets interface. In  addition,  tests	 for  DLPI,  and  Unix
       Domain Sockets, tests for IPv6 may be conditionally compiled-in.


   GLOBAL OPTIONS
       -a sizespec
	      Alter  the  send and receive buffer alignments on the local sys-
	      tem.  This defaults to 8 bytes.

       -A sizespec
	      As -a, but for the remote system.

       -c [rate]
	      Request CPU utilization and service demand calculations for  the
	      local  system. If the optional rate parameter is specified, net-
	      perf will use that instead of calculating the rate itself.

       -C [rate]
	      As -c, but for the remote system.

       -d     Increase the quantity of debugging  output  displayed  during  a
	      test (possibly at the expense of performance).

       -f GMKgmk
	      Change  the units of measure for *_STREAM tests. Capital letters
	      are powers of two, lowercase are powers of ten.

       -F fill_file
	      Pre-fill the send buffers with data from the named file. This is
	      intended to provide a means for avoiding buffers that are filled
	      with data which is trivially easy to compress. A good choice for
	      a	 file  that  should be present on any system is this manpage -
	      netperf.man.  Other files may be provided as part of the distri-
	      bution.

       -h     Display a usage string, and exit.

       -H remote_host,local_host
	      Set the hostname (or IP address) of the remote system. Passing a
	      single name with no comma will only  set	remote_host  and  will
	      leave  selection	of local IP address for the control connection
	      to the stack.  Specifying ",local_host" will only set local_host
	      and will leave remote_host at the default.

       -i max,min
	      Set  the maximum and minimum number of iterations when trying to
	      reach certain confidence levels.

       -I lvl,[,intvl]
	      Specify the confidence level (either  95	or  99	-  99  is  the
	      default)	 and  the  width  of  the  confidence  interval	 as  a
	      percentage (default 10)

       -l testlen
	      Specify the length of the test (default 10 seconds).  A negative
	      value  sets  the number of request/response transactions, or the
	      number of bytes for a stream test.

       -n numcpus
	      Specify the number of CPU’s in the system on those  systems  for
	      which netperf has no way to find the number of CPU’s programati-
	      cally.

       -o sizespec
	      Set an offset from the alignment specified with -a.

       -O sizespec
	      As -o, but for the remote system.

       -p portnum,locport
	      Connect to a listening on the specified port, rather than	 using
	      /etc/services. If ",locport" is specified the control connection
	      will be established from that local port number.	 Specifying  a
	      single  port  number  with no comma will specify only the remote
	      port number and will leave local port number  selection  to  the
	      stack.

       -P 0|1 Show (1) or suppress (0) the test banner.

       -t testname
	      Specify  the  test  to  perform.	 Valid	testnames are (but not
	      always compiled-in):
		     TCP_STREAM
		     TCP_MAERTS
		     TCP_RR
		     TCP_CRR
		     UDP_STREAM
		     UDP_RR
		     TCPIPV6_STREAM
		     TCPIPV6_RR
		     TCPIPV6_CRR
		     UDPIPV6_STREAM
		     UDPIPV6_RR
		     DLCO_STREAM
		     DLCO_RR
		     DLCL_STREAM
		     DLCL_RR
		     STREAM_STREAM
		     STREAM_RR
		     DG_STREAM
		     DG_RR
		     LOC_CPU
		     REM_CPU

       -v verbosity
	      Set the verbosity level for the test (only with -P).

       -V     Enable the copy-avoidance features (HP-UX 9.0 and later only).


   TEST SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       -h     Display a usage string based on the test name set with  -t,  and
	      exit.

	      Benchmark (netperf.ps) for more information. Or you can join and
	      mail to netperf-talk@netperf.org.


BUGS
       There  is  a  fairly large list of known defects and misfeatures in the
       manual. If you think you have found a bug, please send  email  to  Rick
       Jones <raj@cup.hp.com>.
