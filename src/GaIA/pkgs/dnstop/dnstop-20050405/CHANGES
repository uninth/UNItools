    Mark Foster found a bug with the source+SLD list.  It was being
    updated for 3RD-level domain names as well.  Mark also suggested
    that the '@' key should display the source+SLD screen, just as
    '3' and '#' work for 3RD-level.

    Added support for third-level domain statistics.  Use the -t
    command line option to enable collection of 3rd-level stats,
    and use '3' while running to display them.  Note that enabling
    3rd-level stats collection does not automatically also enable
    2nd-level stats.

    Added a non-interactive mode.  If you specify a savefile and
    stdout is not a TTY, dnstop prints each table at the end.

    Added filter support.  Filters can be used to restrict the input
    stream to queries with certain characteristics.  The currently
    defined filters are:

    unknown-tlds        Only includes queries for TLDs that are
			bogus.  Useful for identifying hosts/servers
			that leak queries for things like "localhost"
			or "workgroup."

    A-for-A             Only includes A queries for names that are
			already IP addresses.  Certain Microsoft
			Windows DNS servers have a known bug that
			forward these queries.

    rfc1918-ptr         PTR queries for addresses in RFC1918 space.
			These should never leak from inside an
			organization.

    Added 'c' to display options. This screen will combine the
    source and sld fields to show "who is querying for what" -
    reason: we see alot of duplicate querys for whatever reason.
    This will help separate the legitimate queries from the broken
    resolvers, etc. See http://www.circleid.com/article/102_0_1_0_C/
    for more about that.
