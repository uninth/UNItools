There are some other (useful?) utilities in this directory:

  catpcap	- Displays *everything* in a raw tcpdump(1) pcap file
		  there is to show.  Useful for debuging.

  packetdump	- Another dumping program, written to show the contents
		  of packets better that tcpdump does.

  tcpprof	- A nice program that gives a profile (protocols, ports,
		  hosts, etc...) of the pcap file.  Nice indeed, and I
		  think I will break off this program into it's own
		  distribution someday...
