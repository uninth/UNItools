<p>To me it makes good sence to have strong tools for debugging
network related problems on a firewall.</p>
<p>I am perfectly aware of the consequences regarding security
by placing such tools here, but the trade-off between security
and the ability of debugging networking problems make me beleive
this tool belongs here.
