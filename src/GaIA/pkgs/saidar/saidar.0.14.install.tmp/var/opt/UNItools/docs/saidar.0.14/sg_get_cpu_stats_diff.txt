NAME
       sg_get_cpu_stats,  sg_get_cpu_stats_diff, sg_get_cpu_percents - get cpu
       usage

SYNOPSIS
       #include <statgrab.h>


       sg_cpu_percents *sg_get_cpu_percents(void);

       sg_cpu_stats *sg_get_cpu_stats(void);

       sg_cpu_stats *sg_get_cpu_stats_diff(void);

DESCRIPTION
       sg_get_cpu_stats()  and	sg_get_cpu_stats_diff()	 both  return	static
       pointers	 of  type  sg_cpu_stats.  sg_get_cpu_stats() returns the total
       amount of "ticks" the operating system has spent in each of the differ-
       ent  states.  sg_get_cpu_stats_diff() returns the difference in "ticks"
       for each of the	states	since  last  time  sg_get_cpu_stats_diff()  or
       sg_get_cpu_stats()  was	called.	 If  it has never been called, it will
       return the result of sg_get_cpu_stats().

       The value stored (the "ticks") will vary between operating systems. For
       example Solaris has a total of 100 per second, while Linux has substan-
       tially more. Also, different operating systems store different informa-
       tion - you wonâ€™t find nice cpu on Solaris for example.

       Because	of  this,  you	will  ideally  always  want to work on a scale
       against the total, or in percentages.

       sg_get_cpu_percents() returns a pointer to  a  static  sg_cpu_percents.
       The  function calls sg_get_cpu_stats_diff() and changes the values into
       percentages.  If	 it  has  never	 been  called  before  (and  nor   has
       sg_get_cpu_stats()  or  sg_get_cpu_stats_diff()), the returned percent-
       ages will be the systems total ever since its uptime. (Unless the coun-
       ters have cycled)

RETURN VALUES
       There are two structures returned by the CPU statistics functions.


       typedef struct{
	       long long user;
	       long long kernel;
	       long long idle;
	       long long iowait;
	       long long swap;
	       long long nice;
	       long long total;
	       time_t systime;
       }sg_cpu_stats;



       typedef struct{
	       float user;
	       float kernel;
	       float idle;
	       float iowait;
	       float swap;
	       float nice;
	       time_t time_taken;
       }sg_cpu_percents;


       user  kernel  idle  iowait  swap	 nice
	      The different CPU states.

       systime	time_taken
	      The  time	 taken in seconds since the last call of the function,
	      or the system time.
