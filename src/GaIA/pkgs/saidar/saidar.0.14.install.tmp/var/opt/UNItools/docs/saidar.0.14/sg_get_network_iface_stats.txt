NAME
       sg_get_network_iface_stats - get network interface statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <statgrab.h>


       sg_network_iface_stats *sg_get_network_iface_stats(int *entries);

DESCRIPTION
       The  sg_get_network_iface_stats	function  takes	 a  pointer to an int,
       entries, which is filled with the  number  of  network  interfaces  the
       machine	has.  This  is	needed to know how many sg_network_iface_stats
       structures have been returned. A	 pointer  is  returned	to  the	 first
       sg_network_iface_stats.

       sg_get_network_iface_stats  returns statistics about the network inter-
       faces in the machine. Specifically, it returns the speed of the	inter-
       face, the duplex state, and whether it is currently up.

RETURN VALUES
       The sg_get_network_iface_stats returns a pointer to a structure of type
       sg_network_iface_stats.


       typedef enum{
	       SG_IFACE_DUPLEX_FULL,
	       SG_IFACE_DUPLEX_HALF,
	       SG_IFACE_DUPLEX_UNKNOWN
       }sg_iface_duplex;


       Note: The SG_IFACE_DUPLEX_UNKNOWN value could mean that	duplex	hasnâ€™t
       been negotiated yet.


       typedef struct{
	       char *interface_name;
	       int speed;
	       sg_iface_duplex duplex;
	       int up;
       }sg_network_iface_stats;


       interface_name
	      The  name known to the operating system.	(eg. on linux it might
	      be eth0)

       speed  The speed of the interface, in megabits/sec.

       duplex The duplex state the interface is in.  See  sg_iface_duplex  for
	      permitted values.

       up     Whether the interface is up.
