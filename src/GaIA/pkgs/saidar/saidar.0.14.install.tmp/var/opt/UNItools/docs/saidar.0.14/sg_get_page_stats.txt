NAME
       sg_get_page_stats, sg_get_page_stats_diff - get paging statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <statgrab.h>


       sg_page_stats *sg_get_page_stats(void);

       sg_page_stats *sg_get_page_stats_diff(void);

DESCRIPTION
       sg_get_page_stats and sg_get_page_stats_diff both return a pointer to a
       static buffer of type sg_page_stats.

       sg_get_page_stats will return the number of pages the system has	 paged
       in  and	out since bootup.  sg_get_page_stats_diff will return the dif-
       ference since last time it was  called.	If  it	has  not  been	called
       before, it will return sg_get_page_stats.

RETURN VALUES
       typedef struct{
	       long long pages_pagein;
	       long long pages_pageout;
	       time_t systime;
       }sg_page_stats;


       pages_pagein
	      The number of pages swapped into memory.

       pages_pageout
	      The number of pages swapped out of memory (to swap).

       systime
	      The  time	 period over which pages_pagein and pages_pageout were
	      transferred.

BUGS
       Solaris doesn’t seem to report accurately. It  reports  the  number  of
       pages  swapped  into  memory,  not  necessarily from swap. This feature
       isn’t deemed entirely reliable.
