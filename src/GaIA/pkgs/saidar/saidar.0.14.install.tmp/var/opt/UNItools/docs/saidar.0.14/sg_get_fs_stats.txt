NAME
       sg_get_fs_stats - get filesystem statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <statgrab.h>


       sg_fs_stats *sg_get_fs_stats(int *entries);

DESCRIPTION
       The sg_get_fs_stats takes a pointer to an int, entries, which is filled
       with the number of mounted file systems the  machine  has.  The	return
       value  is  a  pointer  to  the  first member of an array of sg_fs_stats
       structures; the number of entries in the array is returned in  entries.

       The  function  returns  statistics about mounted filesystems, including
       free space and inode usage.

RETURN VALUES
       sg_get_fs_stats returns a pointer to a structure of type sg_fs_stats.

       device_name
	      The name known to the operating system.  (eg. on linux it	 might
	      be hda)

       fs_type
	      The type of the filesystem.

       mnt_point
	      The mount point of the file system.

       size   The size, in bytes, of the file system.

       used   The amount of space, in bytes, used on the filesystem.

       avail  The amount of space, in bytes, available on the filesystem.

       total_inodes
	      The total number of inodes in the filesystem.

       used_inodes
	      The number of used inodes in the filesystem.

       free_inodes
	      The number of free inodes in the filesystem.

       avail_inodes
	      The number of free inodes available to non-privileged processes.

       io_size
	      A suggested optimal block size for IO operations	--  if	youâ€™re
	      reading or writing lots of data, do it in chunks of this size.

       block_size
	      How  big blocks actually are on the underlying filesystem (typi-
	      cally for purposes of stats reporting).

       total_blocks
	      The total number of blocks in the filesystem.

       free_blocks
	      The number of free blocks in the filesystem.

       used_blocks
	      The number of used blocks in the filesystem.

       avail_blocks
	      The number of free blocks available to non-privileged processes.
