Building and Installation
-------------------------

After downloading and extracting libstatgrab, configure and build as
follows;

./configure
make

Then install as root;

make install

There are, of course, the usual GNU-style configure options;

  --prefix=PREFIX

For detailed documentation on the generic installation process, please
read the INSTALL document.

Enhancements of the general configuration process can be seen in the
sections "Optional Features" and "Optional Packages" of the output of

  ./configure --help

Prerequisites
-------------

While libstatgrab will run without additional prerequisites, there are
several options to improve it.

* Having a recent (1.1.0+) version of log4cplus will enable tracing
  functionalities. log4cplus can be found on its homepage here;
  http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/
  Note that libstatgrab doesn't enable its logging automatically,
  the using applications must do it.
* Manpages can be built automatically when docbook2x is installed.
  See http://docbook2x.sourceforge.net/
* On Linux it might be necessary to install the ncurses-dev (or
  equivalent) package to build saidar.
