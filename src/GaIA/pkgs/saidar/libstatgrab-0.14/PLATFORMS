Platform Specific Notes
=======================

Unless explicitly mentioned below assume that libstatgrab will run on
any of the platforms above without any elevated privileges.

Linux
-----

On Linux root privileges are required to get the statistics returned
by the get_network_iface_stats function. Not having these privileges
results in NULL being returned.

Also note that this cannot be solved by calling sg_init and then
sg_drop_privileges at this stage.

FreeBSD 4
---------

On FreeBSD 4 (not on 5) programs need to be setgid kmem to get swap
statistics. It is sufficient to give a program these privileges, call
sg_init, and then drop the privileges using sg_drop_privileges.

The sg_get_swap_stats function will return NULL if this hasn't been done.

Solaris 2.6/2.7
---------------

On Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 root privileges are required to build the drive
mapping list (eg. mapping ssd0 on to c0t0d0s0). If these privileges
aren't available the names will be left as ssd0, for example.

It is sufficient to use sg_init and sg_drop_privileges.

Cygwin
------

Full support for libstatgrab isn't yet provided on cygwin - there are
some stats which we just can't get. In these cases the functions will
return NULL to indicate failure.

If you have installed libncurses-devel but the configure script can't
find ncurses.h, you've most likely hit a bug in the cygwin package. To
fix this run: /etc/postinstall/libncurses-devel.sh.done
