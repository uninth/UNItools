LFT CHANGELOG 

lft 2.5 
----------------------
- Inclusive of betas 2.32 to 2.4x
- Added -z option to pseudo-randomize source port
- Added behavior to automatically select the most appropriate interface
  based on routing (this was on the most wanted list)
- Improved OpenBSD compatibility (IP length nonzero)
- OpenBSD is now detected by autoconf (for configuring the above)
- Darwin is now detected by autoconf and its definition disables
  some BSD features to make it compatible with MacOS X and Darwin
- LFT now indicates it has reached the target by printing a 'T'
  character in the status display (if status is enabled)
- Cleanups were made to the verbose output levels (-VVV)
- Significantly revamped whois framework makes it easy to include
  whois functionality into other programs
- Added -C and -R and -r options to force alternate ASN sources:
    - (r)IPE RIS - special thanks to Rene Wilhelm @ RIPE NCC
    - (C)ymru 
    - (R)ADB 
- Default ASN source (-A) is now Prefix WhoIs (see pwhois.org)
- LFT now queries for ASNs in bulk format after completing
  a trace if pwhois (default), RIPE NCC RIS, or Cymru is selected
- Added dst/src port autoselection based on user-supplied hostname
- Vastly improved standalone whois client "whob" see whob.8 (whob manpage)
- Makefile now installs 'whob' no-frills whois client (try ./whob)
- "Smart" mode is now referred to as "Adaptive" mode (-E)


lft 2.31
--------------------
- Fixed time precision on FreeBSD 5.3 (Thanks to Kurt Jaeger)


lft 2.3:
--------------------
- added WSAIoctl() call to select proper IF on windows based on dest (thanks Graham!)
- lowered max_retries to a default of 2
- cleaned up formatting related to -S option
- cleaned up verbose output to be more friendly
- cleaned up error messages
- updated manpage
- updated spec file


lft 2.2:
--------------------
- removed dependence on regex library
- removed dependence on INT_MAX
- fixed whois code to get the most specific netblock instead of the least specific netblock
- can now specify interface by IP instead of by name


lft 2.1:
--------------------

- Added autoconf support
- Ported to cygwin
- Fixed the Solaris and BSD makefiles (manpage install errors)
- Modified the whois code to resolve ASN and netname lookup 
    problems with RIPE entries.  (-A) and (-N) code...
- Modified the whois code to support local-as
- Vastly streamlined the (-V) verbose output to cover the 
    important information (sequence, etc) of all packets
    sent and received


lft 2.0 (and betas):
--------------------

- (-E) and (-F) shouldn't be used at the same time, now LFT knows that
- Implemented fixes that enable LFT to run under Solaris/SPARC (Jim McKim)
- Changed name from FFT to LFT (layer four trace)
- Added ICMP messages for codes 13-15 
- Changed the (-P) option added in 1.99 to (-E) in order to force use of  
    the new "smart" engine
- Enhanced stateful firewall (packet filter) detection en route
- Engine: "smart" mode now tries FIN, SYN, etc table to get packets through
    which dramatically improves its "find a way" capability
- Engine: "smart" mode now detects the BSD bug properly
- Engine: "smart" mode now detects firewalls in transit
- Compilation: made lft_queue.h the default for all OSs
- UI: lots of user interface changes


lft 1.99-beta(s):
--------------------

- Added Loose Source Routing feature (LSRR) [<gateway> <...>] <target>
- Added (-N) Netblock name lookup feature 
- Added (-A) ASN lookup feature 
- Added (-P) option to automatically send 3 probes for more stats 
- Added (-V) lots of verbose debugging information
- Added (-F) feature to revert to sending FIN packets
- Added (-T) option to show trace and resolution timings (LFT is fast)
- Added BSD 4.[23] and derivative (bug) inappropriate TTL detection
- Engine: Use sequence numbers as packet ID instead of destination port
    numbers. This achieves a number of goals: 
    Return ICMP and TCP packets are more uniquely identified. 
    It is now possible to check the route for specific destination
    port, which is important if route varies based on port (such
    as with transparent proxying using a load balancing switch on
    port 80)  (thank you Ugen!)
- Engine: Send SYN packets. Variety of firewalls and NAT devices won't 
    pass through a single TCP packet that is not a part of established
    connection, unless it carries SYN flag only (initial packet). 
    Pitfall: this may create useless PCB blocks on destination host,
    if it does not use SYN cookies or some other SYN flood protection.
    However it's better then not being able to use lft from behind
    firewalls.  (thank you Ugen!)
- Renamed (-H) max hops/ttl option 
- UI cleaned up in several areas, especially result list & RTT display
- Detect local packet filter


lft 1.91:
---------------------

- Fixed Makefile.solaris (last time we'll see this before autoconf)
- added <sockio.h> for Solaris

lft 1.9:
--------------------

- Default source port is now 53/tcp (dns-xfer)
- Configurable source port on command line through -p or host:port
- Configurable initial destination port on command line using -d 
- Source and Destination ports use /etc/services for lookup
- Fixed a bug that created a gethostbyaddr() call even when the user
  specified NOT to do reverse DNS lookups -- makes -n option way faster!
- Changed the way lft auto-detects the IP address of the interface selected
   * now, we determine what address is assigned to the interface instead of
     just getting the hosts's primary/default address and using it
   * thanks, Aaron, for bringing this to our attention! 
   * thanks, Lane, for coming up with a platform-independent 
     way of making it work.


lft 1.8:
--------------------

- added option to suppress status indicator and only show trace (or errors)
   * people using lft from a web page wanted this
- added option to select the network interface used as hop zero
   * string length of device is tested to avoid potential buffer overflows
- modified the status bar to display:

Send mode: ->( <packet number> / <TTL of packet> )
Recv mode: <{ <TTL of packet received> }

Additional testing platforms for this release:

- Aaron Bentley (Univ Toronto) tested lft successfully under Debian Woody Linux
   * Aaron also contributed a variation of net device selection -- thanks


lft 1.7:
--------------------

- added option to disable reverse DNS host lookups
- made several areas slightly more user-friendly
- modified the status bar to display:

Send mode: ->( <packet number> / <TTL of packet> )
Recv mode: <( <TTL of packet received> )

- changed "source" port from tcp/80 to tcp/25

most firewalls today permit tcp_established implicitly, not traffic
from tcp/80 explicitly, therefore we figured sending packets from 
tcp/25 would be more likely to get through.

- modified initialization of 32-bit unsigned integer used to 
  calculate checksum

LFT now builds again under Solaris, but still miscalculates checksums 

- fixed round trip time calculation 
- several other minor tweaks
- tested under RedHat Linux, Darwin 5.5 (MacOS X v10.1) 

lft 1.6 (nils):
---------------

- Great idea.
