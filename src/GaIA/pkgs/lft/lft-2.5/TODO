LFT TO-DO
---------

Features to ADD (not in any particular order)

 - 64-bit support
 - IPv6 support
 - display min/avg/max/stddev RTT instead of just the samples
 - VJ-type UDP-based tracing for comparison using a '-u' option
 - lookup whois and dns info in background thread (if requested) so it is 
   ready once the trace is complete (on selected platforms)
 - spread after contacting target to expose all paths through inline filter 
 - implement target fingerprinting using TCP timestamps option (RFC 1323)
