.Os WHOB
.Sh NAME
.Nm whob
.Nd display whois-type information of interest to Internet operators
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm whob
.Op Fl h Ar pwhois-server
.Op Fl aCchnopRrstuVv
.Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
queries various sources of whois information for data of interest to network 
operators and their tracing and debugging tools.
.Pp
.Nm
output is designed to be easily parsed, or better yet, its functionality
can be added directly into your programs (see whois.h).  
.Pp
The only mandatory parameter is the target host name or IP number.  
Options toggle the display of more interesting data or change the sources
used to obtain that data.  
.Pp
One key advantage of 
.Nm
is its lookup of ASN information derived from the 
global Internet routing table itself, as opposed to relying solely on what
has been registered in the RADB/IRR (see below).  This data is, by default, 
sourced from the global pWhoIs service.  See www.pwhois.org
.Pp
Other options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar ASN
Display all routing advertisements made by the respective Origin-AS.  The
Origin-AS may be supplied as the target argument, or a hostname or IP address may
be supplied and 
.Nm
will resolve the ASN automatically.
.It Fl P Ar prefix
Display all routing advertisements related to the CIDR prefix supplied by the user.
.It Fl R
Display the Origin-AS on record at the RADB/IRR (Routing Arbiter Database/Internet Routing Registry)
in addition the the Origin-AS provided by the prefix-based whois data source.
.It Fl n
Display the network name on record with the IP network allocation registry also
such as ARIN, RIPE, or APNIC.
.It Fl o
Display the organization name on file at the registrar.
.It Fl p
Display the AS-Path from the perspective of the current pwhois server.  The pwhois
server may automatically exclude the initial, least specific ASN received from 
the operator of the network to which it is connected (unless that ASN is the only/origin 
ASN or unless it has multiple peers). Of course, this AS-Path is subjective.  If you 
rely on this and want AS-Paths that correspond to *your* network infrastructure, you
may want to install your own pwhois server.  See the (-w) option and www.pwhois.org
.It Fl t
Display the date the route was last cached by the pWhoIs server.
.It Fl u
When possible, display dates in UTC/GMT instead of local time.
.It Fl h/w Ar host
Change the source of prefix-based whois data from the default (pWhoIs) to any
pwhois-compatible server of your choice (like your own).
.It Fl c
Change the source of prefix-based whois data from the default (pWhoIs) to Cymru.
See www.cymru.com for more details.
.It Fl r
Display the Origin-AS and prefix according to RIPE NCC RIS (see www.ripe.net/projects/ris/)
.It Fl s
Show the status of the (respective) pWhoIs server and exit(0)
.It Fl V
Display verbose/debug output.  Use multiple 'V's for additional verbosity.
.It Fl v
Display this client's version information and exit(1)
