              entries that span an entire row.
            > Fixed ScreenOS segmentation fault when

              or "Management" zones. (Ref. 1868791)
            > Fixed CEF default for IOS devices. However,
              the model needs to be specified at the
              command line. It is enabled by default for
              specific devices and disabled for all others.
              An improvement, but not perfect.
              (Ref. 1869191)

Version: 0.10.0
Date   : 17/06/2007
Author : Ian Ventura-Whiting (Fizz)
Notes  : This release concentrates on adding a large number
         of additional features for IOS-based devices. IOS
         devices contain far more configuration options than
         all the other devices combined. Additionally, Cisco
         CSS devices have been added as another supported
         device type. Other device types will have support
         extended in upcoming versions.
Warning: The subversion repository now contains testdata.
         I would very strong advise against using those
         configurations on any devices, they are intended
         for testing purposes only. Use those configs at
         your own risk.

              edge routing device *
            > Added command line option to specify a
              device name. It helps for configs where
              the name is not specified in the config. *
            > Much better documentation.
