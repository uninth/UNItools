    The Network Infrastructure Parser

Nipper does not have to be compiled under the Windows platform
as a pre-built version is available for download.

The nipper configuration file, nipper.conf is stored in /etc
on UNIX systems. Under Windows Nipper will look for a file
called nipper.ini in the current directory.

Nipper can be compiled and installed using a number of
different methods. Select one of the following:


1) install.script (UNIX)

   This method applies to UNIX platforms only. The shell script
   will compile the source code and then copy the built program
   to the /usr/bin directory.

   To compile and install Cisco Parse enter the following
   command as root:

      ./install.script


2) Makefile (UNIX and Mac)

   The CMake program is required for this method. CMake can be
   found at http://www.cmake.org.

   To compile and install using CMake use the following
   commands:

      make
      make install    (root user privileges)


3) Manual (All platforms)

   Nipper can be compiled and installed manually using the
   following commands:

      gcc -o nipper nipper.c
      cp nipper /usr/bin/
      cp nipper.conf /etc/
      cp man/nipper.1 /usr/share/man/man1/
      cp man/nipper.conf.5 /usr/share/man/man5/
