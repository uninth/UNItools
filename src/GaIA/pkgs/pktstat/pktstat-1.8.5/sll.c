/*
 * libpcap for Linux provides synthetic framing for AF_PACKET sockets
 * (cf. SOCK_RAW) by prefixing data with a struct sll_header structure
 * derived from the AF_PACKET 'from' address structure.
 *
 * From libpcap/tcpdump's (private) "sll.h", we are told the 
 *
 *	"fake header includes:
 *	 a 2-byte 'packet type' which is one of:
 *		LINUX_SLL_HOST		[0] packet was sent to us
 *		LINUX_SLL_BROADCAST	[1] packet was broadcast
 *		LINUX_SLL_MULTICAST	[2] packet was multicast
 *		LINUX_SLL_OTHERHOST	[3] packet was sent to somebody else
 *		LINUX_SLL_OUTGOING	[4] packet was sent *by* us;
 *	 a 2-byte Ethernet protocol field;
 *	 a 2-byte link-layer type;
 *	 a 2-byte link-layer address length;
 *	 an 8-byte source link-layer address, whose actual length is
 *		specified by the previous value.
 *	 All fields except for the link-layer address are in network
 *	 byte order."
 *
 * This is misleading: the 'Ethernet protocol field' is actually last.
 * The 'Ethernet protocol field' also takes the same values as Linux's 
 * ETH_P_ values from <linux/if_ether.h>. Luckilly, these seem to be
 * the same as the standard ethernet protocol identifiers. The code below
 * may break if libpcap/linux-bpf.c or linux/if_ether.h change.
