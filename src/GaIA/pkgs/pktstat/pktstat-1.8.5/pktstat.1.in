.Sh NAME
.Nm pktstat
.Nd display packet activity on a crt
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pktstat
.Op Fl 1BcFlnpPtT
.Op Fl a Ar abbrev
.Op Fl A Ar file
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl k Ar keeptime
.Op Fl m Ar maxbps
.Op Fl w Ar waittime
.Op Ar filter-expr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program displays a real-time summary of packet activity on an interface.
Each line displays the data rate associated with different classes of packets.
.Pp
.Nm
understands the following command line options:
.Bl -tag -width 12ex -offset indent
.It Fl 1
Single-shot (batch) mode.
.Nm
collects data for
.Ar waittime
seconds (see
.Fl w
option)
then emits a line indicating the number of flows detected, and
the period of data capture in seconds.
Then, each flow line is printed in the form of the number of
data link octets associated with the flow, the number of
data link frames (packets), and then the flow description.
.It Fl a Ar abbrev
Add
.Ar abbrev
to the list of abbreviation patterns.
(See below for details.)
.It Fl A Ar file
Read abbreviation patterns from the given
.Ar file .
(See
.Sx Abbreviations ,
below.)
If the option
.Fl A Ic none
is given, then default abbreviation files are not loaded.
.It Fl B
Display data rates in bytes per second (Bps) instead of
in bits per second (bps).
.It Fl c
Do not combine some packet classes into one class.
For example, TCP connections are kept as two separate flows.
.\" .It Fl E
.\" Don't exit on errors from the
.\" .Xr pcap 3
.\" library.
.It Fl F
Show full hostnames.
Normally, hostnames are truncated to the first component of their domain name
before display.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Listen on the given interface.
If not specified, a suitable interface is chosen.
.It Fl k Ar keeptime
When no packets have been seen for a particular class,
retain an entry on the display for this many screen seconds.
Defaults to 10.
.It Fl l
Display and sort flows by when they were last seen.
(Incompatible with
.Fl t )
.It Fl m Ar maxbps
Fix the maximum bit rate for the interface at
.Ar maxbps
instead of auto-detecting it.
.It Fl n
Do not try and resolve hostnames or service port numbers.
.It Fl p
Show packet counts instead of bit counts.
.It Fl P
Do not try to put the interface into promiscuous mode.
.It Fl t
"Top" mode.
Sorts the display by bit count (or packet count if
.Fl p
was given) instead of by
the name.
.It Fl T
Show totals.
.It Fl w Ar waittime
Refresh the display every
.Ar waittime
seconds.
The default is 5 seconds.
.It Ar filter-expr
Only consider packets matching the given
.Ar filter-expr .
If no filter is provided, all packets are considered.
See
.Xr tcpdump 8
for information on valid expressions.
.El
.Pp
If the terminal supports it, the display briefly highlights in bold
new connections or old connections carrying data after a period
of inactivity.
.Pp
Simple statistics about the interface are also displayed such as 
the current and average bit rates (measured just above the data link layer).
Load averages refer to bit rate decayed averages for the last 1, 5 and 15
minutes.
.Pp
During display, the following keystrokes are recognised:
.Bl -tag -width Ic -offset indent
.It Ic q
quit
.It Ic Ctrl-L
redraw screen
.It Ic t
toggle the
.Fl t
flag (top mode)
.It Ic T
toggle the
.Fl T
flag (totals mode)
.It Ic w
allows changing of the
.Fl w
flag value (wait time)
.It Ic n
toggle the
.Fl n
flag (numeric display)
.It Ic p
toggle the
.Fl p
flag (packets instead of bits)
.It Ic b | B
toggle the
.Fl B
flag (bps or Bps)
.It Ic f | F
toggle the
.Fl F
flag (full hostnames)
.It Ic r
reset collected statistics (min, max, etc.),
flush flow history and reset DNS/service and fragment caches
.It Ic l
show and sort flows by when they were last active
.It Ic ?
toggle display of help/status text at the bottom of the display
.El
.Ss Packet classes
.Pp
All packet classes, or flows, are
.Qq tagged
with a descriptive string, such as
.Ql "tcp ftpserver:20524 <-> cathexis:17771" .
.Pp
In addition to being tagged, some protocol-state information can
be associated with a flow. This is displayed immediately below a flow line.
Descriptive information for FTP, HTTP, X11 and SUP connections is determined
from simple decoding of some packets.
If the connection is 'open', it is introduced with a right angle shape (+),
otherwise it is introduced with a hyphen character.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tcp www:80 <-> hamartia:19179
+ GET /index.html
.Ed
.\"
.Ss Abbreviations
.Pp
Abbreviation patterns are a way of further combining flows.
As packets are decoded, their flow name is constructed at the various
protocol layers. At address combining stage (where arrows such as
.Ql "->"
are inserted)
and at the final display stage, flow names are checked against
a list of abbreviation patterns,
and the abbreviation's name substituted if a match is found.
For example, the pattern
.Ql "* <-> *:domain"
will match DNS packets in both the UDP and TCP layers.
.Pp
Abbreviations take the form
.Op Ar abbrev Ns Li @ Ns
.Ar pattern .
The
.Ar pattern
part can contain the wildcard character, asterisk
.Ql *
which matches zero or more non-space characters.
The space character
matches one or more whitespace characters.
Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
.Pp
If the optional
.Ar abbrev
is not specified, the the pattern text itself is used as the abbreviation.
.Pp
Patterns are checked in the order given on the command line or in the files,
i.e. as soon as one of the patterns matches a tag, no further patterns
are considered.
Recall that patterns can be applied multiple times to a tag.
.Pp
A patterns file can contain blank lines, which are ignored.
Comment lines that commence with a
.Ql #
character are also ignored.
.Pp
After processing all command line abbreviations and
abbreviation files,
.Nm pktstat
looks for and loads the files
.Pa ".pktstatrc" ,
.Pa $HOME/.pktstatrc
and
.Pa @PATH_PKTSTATRC@ .
This behaviour is suppressed by supplying an
.Fl A Ic none
option.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
Here are the contents of my
.Pa .pktstatrc
file:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dns @ udp *:domain <-> *
dns @ udp * <-> *:domain
irc @ udp 192.168.0.81:6666 <-> *

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
DNS lookups can take too much time, possibly leading to missed packets.
.Pp
The data rates do not take into account data link framing overhead or
compression savings at the data link layer.
.Pp
The direction of traffic is not taken into account: both ingress and
egress data rates are combined. If you want to separate them, you will need
to use a filter expression.
.Pp
Descriptive information for X11, FTP, HTTP and SUP flows is derived from the
very first packets sent on those protocols.
If you start
.Nm
after any of these flows have commenced, there may be no description
available for them.
