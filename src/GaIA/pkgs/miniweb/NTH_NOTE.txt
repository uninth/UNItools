Hi everybody,
Just wanted to share that if you don't want to browse across the source files and you need to configure miniweb these are the parameters:
-p port (integer)
-r path (path to dir)
-l logfile (path to file)
-m maxclients (integer)
-d ListDirectories (boolean)
Example:
miniweb.exe -p 80 -r c:\httproot -l c:\miniweb\miniweb.log -m 500 -d 1
