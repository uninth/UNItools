di - disk information utility (version 4.9).

DESCRIPTION

  'di' is a disk information utility, displaying everything
  (and more) that your 'df' command does. It features the
  ability to display your disk usage in whatever format you
  desire/prefer/are used to. It is designed to be portable
  across many platforms.

INSTALLATION

  To build with mkconfig.pl (requires perl):

      ./Build distclean
      ./Build -mkc              CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build -mkc
      ./Build -mkc install      CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build -mkc install

  To build with iffe:
                              Example w/gcc and different prefix.
      ./Build distclean
      ./Build                   CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build
      ./Build install           CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build install
                         gcc sometimes requires -lintl for internationalization
                                LIBS="-lintl" CC=gcc ./Build
                                LIBS="-lintl" CC=gcc ./Build install

  To turn off NLS (internationalization):

      ./Build -mkc -nonls            CC=gcc ./Build -mkc -nonls
      ./Build -mkc -nonls install    CC=gcc ./Build -mkc -nonls install

  The CC, CFLAGS, prefix, LDFLAGS, and LIBS environment
  variables may be set and exported prior to running make.

  The LOCALEDIR environment variable may be set to the installation
  directory for the locale files.  Default is ${prefix}/share/locale.

  The internationalization files are automatically installed if
  your system supports internationalization.
  [en_US: 27-Aug-2002, de_DE: 26-Feb-2004].

  To force a 64 bit binary build:
      ./Build -64

  Installation Permissions:
    Some systems (Sys V variants) only allow root to read the
    mount table.  If this is the case, change the INSTPERM macro
    in the Makefile should be set to 4111, and the USER macro to root.
    In SysV.4 and Solaris, the mount command would reset the
    permissions to be root readable only (fixed in Solaris 7).

    If this is needed on your system, do:

    make installperms

  Windows installation:

    You may need to undefine _lib_GetDiskFreeSpaceEX
    in the config.h file for older windows systems.

    (1) and (2) will build using the windows API.

    If you prefer to use the cygwin API rather than the
    windows API, edit config.h, and undefine _hdr_windows,
    _lib_GetDiskFreeSpace, _lib_GetDiskFreeSpaceEx,
    _lib_GetDriveType, _lib_GetLogicalDriveStrings and
    _lib_GetVolumeInformation, then re-run the build.

    Alternative 1)
        Cygnus gcc: make windows-gcc
        MS VC++:    nmake windows
    Alternative 2)
        ./Build distclean
        CC=gcc ./Build

BUGS

    Solaris 2.6 has a bug in the kernel and reports the reserved
    space incorrectly.  There is a kernel patch available (105572-05?).

    Send bug reports along with the output from 'di -A -a -X 5' and the
    output from your standard df command (as verbose as possible) to:

        di-bugs@gentoo.com

    If the Build script doesn't set up the 'config.h'
    file correctly, please let me know.  E-mail me the incorrect
    (and corrected if possible) config.h file, and any other
    information as appropriate.

CHANGES

    4.9                                     [2 Nov 2006]
        Fixed an uninitialized variable used for Solaris zones.
        Minor fixes to mkconfix.pl.

    4.8                                     [5 Oct 2006]
        Linux's statvfs() is not POSIX compliant and does not
        use f_frsize.  The correct value is returned in f_bsize.
        Since there's no way to tell which type of statvfs() is
        in use, we have to hard-code the logic for linux.
        This sucks.

        More minor improvements to mkconfig.pl.

        Add logic to find the correct msgfmt program to use.

    4.7                                     [23 Sep 2006]
        Changed the operation of the -a, -x and -I flags
        so that it is possible to specify -a and still exclude
        filesystems from the list.
        Added the -L flag to not check for duplicate filesystems.

    4.6                                     [3 Sep 2006]
        Improve mkconfig.pl configuration to be more robust,
        find needed libraries.  Improve mkconfig.pl portability.

    4.5                                     [29 Mar 2006]
        Fix uninitialized variable.
        Fix manual page formatting.

    4.4                                     [21 Nov 2005]
        Add zone support for Solaris (-z).
        Update mkconfig.pl for compatibility w/perl 5.005.

    4.3                                     [29 Oct 2005]
        Change -P option and POSIXLY_CORRECT environment
            variable to display POSIX standard output.
        Add 'a' and '3' format options to display %avail
            and %free space (request by Bill Poser).
        Add check and routine to use getvfsstat() for NetBSD 3.x.
        Add processing of DI_ARGS environment variable.

    4.2                                     [12 Oct 2005]
        Added -nonls argument to 'Build' to turn off all NLS.
        Add +DAportable for HP-UX 10.x.
        Add -qmaxmem=-1 for AIX.
        Fix compile warning in dilib.c for AIX.
        Improve tests for libintl.sl for HP-UX.
            Check /usr/local for libintl.sl also.
        Version number was inadverdently left as 4.1.

    4.1                                     [6 Aug 2005]
        Created a perl script as an alternative to iffe
            to create the config.h file.
        Internationalization configuration now works for Cygwin,
            FreeBSD, NetBSD and HP/UX.

        Metadist is no longer supported; Only the iffe configuration
            method is now available.
        Removed -h help flag, changed it to be scaled alternative 1
            display to match other 'df' programs.
        Alias -x to -i to match other 'df' programs. -x will be preferred.
            Old -x (debug) changed to -X.
        POSIX -dp flag was broken.  Removed.  Added -P option.
        Alias -F to -I for compatibility.

            NLS routines are detected.

        Fixed bug: checking mount options to see if partition
        was read-only (bsd style get/set/endmntent).

    3.10                                    [26 feb 2004]
        Added German .po file (Many thanks to Hartmut Haase).
        Added -64 to Build for 64 bit binaries.
        Added missing internationalization calls in di.c.

        before doing stat().   Otherwise we pick up normal files.
        Update iffe.
        Add exa, zetta, yotta support (-de, -dz, -dy).
        Add support for 1000 byte base block size (and others) (-b option).

        Fix bugs in -s command line option.  Make more friendly.
        Add -H (-dh) scaled display format.
        nfs mounts are always remote.

        Bug fixes for SunOS 4.

        Added getfsstat() for Compaq Tru-64 (and FreeBSD, etc.) systems.
        Compaq Tru-64 code cleaned up.
        Thanks to Compaq for their test drive program!

        Fixed so di doesn't statfs() the disks it doesn't need to.
        Removed fs basetype stuff.
        Split out disk routines into separate module.  Lots of cleanup.
        Totals: fix to take into account block size of partition.
        Totals: ignore read-only, partitions not normally printed.
        Totals: ignore memory filesystems (tmpfs, memfs).

    2.3                                     [24 feb 2000]
        Modified hints for solaris to do 64 bit compilation.
        Removed extra libc setting for linux.

        Hints for dec_osf added.
        Changed HAS_GETMNTINFOFSIZE to be preferred over

        Made installperm as separate target in makefile.
        Modified duplicate checking slightly.

        on FreeBSD.  Hopefully will work w/nfs mounts.

    2.0                                     [15 apr 1999]
        Now uses dist 3.0PL70 for configuration.
        Duplicate filesystems (automounted) are not displayed.
        This probably does not work for Digital's advfs.

    1.24
        Added Windows w/gcc.
        The Solaris 2.6 statvfs() bug has a patch out for it.
        Patch #105572-05 (?).

        Added Windows.  Don't know the routines to get the number
        of file slots or the file system type (FAT12/16/32).
        Changed default to display megabytes.

    1.21                                    [8 sep 1997]
        Fixed AIX typo.
        Linux 2.x

    1.20
        Added Solaris large file system support.  Note that
        ver 2.6 Beta_Update has a bug in the statvfs() routine,
        and the non-root available disk space is improperly
        reported.

    1.19                                    [4 feb 1996]
        Added mount time, mount options.  Link di to the mi command.

        Added -l flag for local filesystems only.
