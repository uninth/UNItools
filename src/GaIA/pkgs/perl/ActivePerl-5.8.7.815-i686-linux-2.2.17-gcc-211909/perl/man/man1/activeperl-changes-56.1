\&\fI\s-1PPM2\s0 and \s-1PPM3\s0\fR
.PP
\&\s-1PPM3\s0 has \fBnot\fR been updated to the latest version \s-1PPM\s0 3.1 as shipped
with the ActivePerl 5.8 series.  \s-1PPM\s0 3.1 assumes that \s-1PPM\s0 2.x is no
longer installed and doesn't synchronize package information with it.
Since \s-1PPM2\s0 is the default \s-1PPM\s0 version in ActivePerl 5.6, \s-1PPM3\s0 has been
kept at version 3.0.
.PP
\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, a potential buffer overrun in the \fIstat()\fR function has been
fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, a handle leak in \fIkill()\fR has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, a memory leak in \fIfork()\fR has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows \s-1NT\s0 and later, subprocesses are now started via \*(L"cmd /x/d/c\*(R"
instead of \*(L"cmd /x/c\*(R".  This disables execution of AutoRun command
specified in the registry.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, the four-argument form of \fIselect()\fR did not report the
$! (errno) value properly after errors.  This has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\fIWin32::GetOSVersion()\fR returns additional information about the system
(when available, Windows \s-1NT\s0 \s-1SP6\s0 and later).
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 would sometimes close a filehandle twice.  This leads
to a race condition where another thread could have reused the
filehandle before the second close would be executed.  This usually
happens in high load scenarios.  Typical symptoms include error
messages that Perl could not load standard modules, even though they
are installed on the server.
.Sp
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 no longer closes filehandles implicitly and relies now
on the application to properly clean up file and socket handle
resources.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 now avoids closing the special handles \s-1STDIN\s0, \s-1STDOUT\s0
and \s-1STDERR\s0, even if the script asked for that explicitly.
.IP "\(bu" 8

On Linux, the \fIcrypt()\fR builtin did not return consistent results.
This has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The \fIreval()\fR and \fIrdo()\fR methods in the Safe module could be subverted
into executing unsafe code by the callee.  This problem has been
corrected.
.PP
\&\fIOther Bug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
Overloading \f(CW\*(C`bool\*(C'\fR could result in core dumps in some situations.
This has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, sockets opened by code running under PerlScript and
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 were not fully closed internally.  The ensuing leak
resulted in failure to open files or sockets after a certain
number of sockets had been opened and closed under these environments.
This problem was particularly severe when running under ActivePerl
5.6.1.632 or 5.6.1.633, and is now fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, PerlScript and Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 were affected by a reentrancy
problem, which meant that recursive invocation of these two engines
could fail.  This problem has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM3\s0 includes a number of bug fixes for better handling of both \s-1PPM2\s0
and \s-1PPM3\s0 repositories.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Tk and libwww-perl have been updated to their latest versions.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::EventLog could fail to retrieve messages under some circumstances.
This has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::OLE has been updated.  Run \*(L"perldoc Win32::OLE::NEWS\*(R" for
a summary.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Shortcut no longer calls \fICoUninitialize()\fR within an \s-1END\s0 block.
This avoids random coredumps from this module when its \s-1DESTROY\s0 methods
happen to get called after the \s-1END\s0 block executes.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Job now propagates environment changes to its subprocesses
correctly.
.IP "\(bu" 8
A \fIWin32::GetFolderPath()\fR builtin is now supported.
Run \*(L"perldoc Win32\*(R" for documentation on this new builtin.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 v2 and v3 can now optionally generate \s-1HTML\s0 documentation when
installing packages if \s-1POD\s0 documentation is found in the package.
This is controlled by the rebuildhtml option in \s-1PPM\s0 v2 and the
rebuild-html option in \s-1PPM\s0 v3.

The \s-1PPM3\s0 release included in Build 632 had a bug in the package upgrade
functionality.  This has been corrected in \s-1PPM\s0 v3.0.1.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Some modules that autoloaded their constants could reset $! during
autoloading.  Such locations now properly localize $! before potentially
modifying it.
.IP "\(bu" 8
IO::Pipe now works on Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 8
libwin32 v0.191 is included on Windows.

.IP "\(bu" 8
Compress-Zlib is now linked with zlib v1.1.4, which fixes a buffer overflow
vulnerability in this library.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The version of SOAP-Lite included in ActivePerl 5.6.1.631 and earlier
allowed untrusted data to call any subroutine that is defined in the
program that loads SOAP::Lite, or in any modules used by the program.
SOAP-Lite v0.55, included in this release of ActivePerl, contains a
fix for this issue.
.PP
\&\fIOther Bug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
Redirecting STD* handles with \f(CW\*(C`open(STDOUT, "\*(C'\fR&=FOO")> leaked memory
on all platforms.  This leak has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Race conditions involving backticks, piped \fIopen()\fR have been fixed.
These problems could affect environments where multiple Perl interpreters
execute in concurrent threads.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Use of the range operator on constant numbers, as for example \f(CW1..20\fR,
could result in compile-time stricture checks being disabled for parts
of the program.  The problem has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
XSUBs can now be undefined using \fIundef()\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Unix platforms, \f(CW%ENV\fR and  \f(CW%SIG\fR handling could result in race conditions.
Changes to \f(CW%ENV\fR and \f(CW%SIG\fR are now only propagated to the underlying system
process context within the top level interpreter.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Unix platforms, ActivePerl now uses reentrant versions of library
functions, where available.  This further improves thread-safety in
multiple-interpreter environments.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\fIWin32::GetLongPathName()\fR did not work correctly if there were \*(L".\*(R" or
\&\*(L"..\*(R" components in the argument.  The implementation has been improved
to handle this better.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows platforms, a \fIWin32::SetChildShowWindow()\fR builtin is now
supported.  This can be used to set the visibility of child process
windows.  See Win32 for more information.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Newer versions of the following modules are included: Digest\-MD5,
MIME\-Base64, \s-1URI\s0, HTML\-Parser, libwww\-perl, SOAP\-Lite, and libnet.
.IP "\(bu" 8
libwin32 has been updated on Windows platforms.  There is support for
job objects (available in Windows 2000 and \s-1XP\s0) through the new Win32::Job
extension, which can be used to manage a group of processes.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows platforms, the installer ensures that the Microsoft Installer
automatic repair \*(L"feature\*(R" will not be triggered.  This ensures that the
repair \*(L"feature\*(R" does not corrupt the ActivePerl installation by \*(L"repairing\*(R"
critical files to their unrelocated state.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Documentation for perl programs is now included in the table of contents.
.Sh "Build 631 Monday, December 31, 2001"
.IX Subsection "Build 631 Monday, December 31, 2001"
\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
ActivePerl 5.6.1.628 introduced a memory leak in \f(CW\*(C`eval "..."\*(C'\fR expressions
that create anonymous subroutines.  This has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, the behavior of system(@list) has been further rationalized to
improve compatibility with the behavior before 5.6.1.630.  Automatic quoting of
arguments with whitespace is now skipped if the argument already contains
double quotes anywhere within it.  Previously, the double quotes needed
to be at both ends in order for further quoting to be skipped.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Bugs in command.com on Windows 9x/Me prevented the \fIsystem()\fR enhancements
in ActivePerl 5.6.1.630 from working in some situations.  These enhancements
are now disabled under Windows 9x/Me.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 and PerlScript had a bug in ActivePerl 5.6.1.630 that
caused \fIsystem()\fR and backticks to leak handles, resulting in failure of
these functions after a certain number of invocations.  This has been
corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
ActivePerl 5.6.1.629 and later had a problem in Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 that
caused \f(CW%ENV\fR modifications done by the script to affect the real
environment, resulting in incompatible behavior of scripts that assumed
the older behavior.  The behavior before 5.6.1.629 has been reinstated.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, the internal memory allocator used by Perl could fail after
around 1 \s-1GB\s0 of allocations even though more memory may be available on
the system.  Allocating up to and beyond 2GB is now possible if the
system has memory available and allows a single process to allocate
that amount of memory.  Note that most Windows systems running on
x86 have a 2GB limit on allocations by a single process.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Non-blocking \fIwaitpid()\fR on any process (a.k.a. waitpid(\-1, \s-1WNOHANG\s0)) is now
supported on Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Due to popular demand, the following modules are now included by default:
Storable, Tk, and XML\-Simple.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 v3 beta 3 is included.  A number of bugs in beta 2 have been fixed.
Installing from URLs (http, ftp, and file) and installing through a \s-1HTTP\s0
proxy server are now supported.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Compress-Zlib and MIME\-Base64 have been updated to their latest versions.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Due to popular demand, \s-1HTML\s0 documentation has been reintroduced into the
default installation for Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Various other minor bugs have been fixed.  See the ActivePerl bug database
at http://bugs.ActiveState.com/ for more information.

\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 v3 beta 2 is included.  This version of \s-1PPM\s0 is a complete rewrite,
and comes with many new features and improvements, including support
for managing installation profiles through the \s-1ASPN\s0 web site.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Many of the standard extensions supplied with Perl have been audited
for the use of C \*(L"static\*(R" variables and fixed to avoid such uses, making
these extensions safe to use in multi-threaded environments such as
PerlEx and PerlMx Enterprise.  The list includes B, DynaLoader,
File::Glob, DB_File, Opcode, and re.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The \fIreadline()\fR (aka \*(L"diamond\*(R") operator now works on \*(L"our\*(R" variables.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, \fIsystem()\fR and backticks behave more sanely with respect to
whitespace in arguments.  Any whitespace inside quoted arguments are
correctly preserved.  \fIsystem()\fR with multiple arguments also automatically
quotes any arguments that contain whitespace by enclosing them in
double\-quotes, as necessary.  This improves portability of the standard
idiom of calling \fIsystem()\fR with multiple arguments.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, \fIIO::File::new_tmpfile()\fR does not fail after 32767 calls
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, entries in \f(CW%ENV\fR were sometimes being improperly propagated
to child processes if such entries happened to be at the end of the
internal process environment table.  This misbehavior has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
PerlScript and Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 ignore the \e\e?\e prefix in new-fangled
file names returned by \s-1IIS\s0 in Windows \s-1XP\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 8
In scripts running under PerlScript or Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0, \fIprint()\fR with
more than one argument did not print the second and subsequent arguments.
This has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The style and content of the included online documentation has been
extensively revised.  On Windows, all the documentation is now provided
in fully searchable \s-1HTML\s0 Help format.  Documentation in conventional
\&\s-1HTML\s0 format continues to be included only for Unix platforms, and can
also be downloaded separately.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Some of the bundled modules have been updated to their latest available
versions: libwin32 v0.18, \s-1URI\s0 v1.17, and SOAP-Lite v0.51 are now included.

.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl now uses the reentrant versions of time functions \fIlocaltime_r()\fR,
\&\fIgmtime_r()\fR, and \fIasctime_r()\fR on Unix platforms, making the corresponding
builtins and \fIPOSIX::asctime()\fR thread\-safe.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, child processes launched with \fIWin32::Spawn()\fR now correctly
inherit any modifications to \f(CW%ENV\fR done by the script.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, modifications to \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1PATH\s0} in the script correctly affect
the lookup of executables in \fIsystem()\fR and backticks.  Previous versions
did not propagate \f(CW%ENV\fR modifications completely enough for the underlying
\&\fICreateProcess()\fR system call to notice any changes.
.IP "\(bu" 8
A small number of minor bug fixes from the Perl development track have been
incorporated.  See the ActivePerl source code diff for the complete list.

Perl's \f(CW\*(C`newSVrv()\*(C'\fR \s-1API\s0 function could result in corrupt data when coercing an
already initialized value to the right type, and could also lead to memory
leaks.  Win32::OLE v0.14 tickled these bugs.  \f(CW\*(C`newSVrv()\*(C'\fR has been fixed to
resolve these issues.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl's optimizer could coredump on stacked assignments involving \f(CW\*(C`split()\*(C'\fR,
such as \f(CW\*(C`@a = @b = split(...)\*(C'\fR.  This is now fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Windows sockets weren't being initialized correctly in child threads if the
parent already initialized it.  This resulted in \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR on a socket
created under such conditions not being handled correctly (whereas \f(CW\*(C`send()\*(C'\fR
would do the right thing).  The problem has been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::OLE v0.14 had a bug that could cause strings longer than 256 characters
to be truncated by a single character.  This has been corrected.

.IP "\(bu" 8
On Unix platforms, ActivePerl is now built with the \f(CW\*(C`\-Duseithreads\*(C'\fR
Configure option, just as on Windows.  While this provides a functionally
identical perl, it also makes this build binary incompatible with earlier
builds on Unix platforms.  If you had installed any extensions (i.e. modules
with \s-1XS\s0 code) using earlier builds via \s-1PPM\s0 or otherwise, you will need
to reinstall them under this build.  Future builds will maintain binary
compatibility with this one.
.Sp
On Windows, this build continues to be binary compatible with build 613.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The installation location for the native installations on Unix (Red Hat
\&\s-1RPM\s0, Debian dpkg, or Solaris pkgadd) have changed.  These packages will
now be installed under /usr/local/ActivePerl\-5.6/ rather than under
/usr/local/perl\-5.6.  This one-time change avoids confusion with locally
installed versions built from the sources, and also avoids installing
on top of existing binary-incompatible build 613 installations.
.Sp
The installation location can be chosen as usual on Windows, and when
installing using the generic installers on Unix.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, \fIchdir()\fR could sometimes fail to return failure when given a
non-existent directory, and \s-1UNC\s0 paths didn't work correctly.  These

This series is built around development versions of Perl 5.006. Build 600
corresponds to Perl 5.005_57.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Significant changes that have occurred in the
5.006 development track are documented in perldelta.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Build 600 includes additional changes for supporting globalization.  All
Win32 \s-1API\s0 calls made by Perl now follow the utf8 mode of the interpreter.
Wide versions of the \s-1API\s0 calls are made when utf8 is in effect.  See utf8
for more information on enabling support for Unicode.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The 600 series is not binary compatible with builds in the 500 series. Any
extensions built using binaries from the ActivePerl 500 series will need
to be recompiled.  Note especially that this applies to PPDs that may have
been built for 500 series builds.
