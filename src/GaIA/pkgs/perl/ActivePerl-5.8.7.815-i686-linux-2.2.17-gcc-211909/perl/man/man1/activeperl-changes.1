Build 815 is based on Perl 5.8.7.
.PP
\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
The PerlEx plugin for \s-1IIS\s0 has been added to ActivePerl for Windows.
It caches precompiled \s-1CGI\s0 scripts in memory to increase their
performance.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The table of contents for the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation has been reverted
back to the format used before build 813 (it no longer requires
JavaScript to be enabled).
.IP "\(bu" 8
ExtUtils::MakeMaker now generates and installs \s-1HTML\s0 documentation
automatically.  Regardless how modules are being installed (via \s-1PPM\s0,
through the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell, or by manual compilation and installation),
the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation is always kept up\-to\-date.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Code snippets in the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation are syntax colored.  This
feature is currently only available on Windows and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.
.IP "\(bu" 8
ActiveState::Scineplex has been added on Windows and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  This
module analyzes source code for various programming languages and is
being used to colorize the code snippets in the \s-1HTML\s0 documentation.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The ActivePerl::Config module has been added. It allows perl's
configuration options to be overridden.  The module can also
automatically reconfigure ActivePerl for alternative compilation
environments when the default compiler cannot be found.
.Sp
On Windows, MakeMaker will use the \fIgcc.exe\fR compiler from MinGW and
the \fIdmake.exe\fR utility if the Microsoft Visual \*(C+ compiler
\&\fIcl.exe\fR and the \fInmake.exe\fR utility are not available on the
\&\s-1PATH\s0. This will also work automatically from within the \s-1CPAN\s0 shell.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The \fIperl-static\fR executable on Unix will now pick up a matching
Config.pm (there is no statically linked Perl on Windows).
.IP "\(bu" 8
File::Path's \fIrmtree()\fR function has been replaced to address
security vulnerability \s-1CAN\-2005\-0448\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Fixed incompatiblity problem with Tk and Encode version 2.10 which was
introduced in build 813 (perl\-5.8.7).
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\fIWin32::GetOSName()\fR can now identify Windows Vista.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Various ActiveState::* utility modules have been added.
.IP "\(bu" 8
libwin32 has been updated to version 0.26:
.RS 8
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32API::File
.Sp
New \fIGetFileAttributes()\fR function and corresponding constants.
.Sp
Added \fIGetFileSize()\fR, \fIgetFileSize()\fR, \fIsetFilePointer()\fR, and
\&\fIGetOverlappedResult()\fR functions. The file position operations can use
Math::BigInt objects.
.Sp
Experimental new object oriented interface added. This will be moved
into a separate module in a later release.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32API::Registry
.Sp
Added \s-1DELETE/READ_CONTROL/WRITE_DAC/WRITE_OWNER/SYNCHRONIZE\s0 as KEY_*.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Clipboard
.Sp
\&\fIGetBitmap()\fR should now work correctly with 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit,
16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit colors.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Console
.Sp
Renamed \s-1GRAY\s0 to \s-1LIGHTGRAY\s0 and added definitions for the \*(L"real\*(R" \s-1GRAY\s0
colors.
.Sp
Added \fIget_Win32_IPC_HANDLE()\fR method so that Win32::IPC can wait
on a console handle.
.Sp
Added \fISetIcon()\fR method to change the icon of the window.
.Sp
Don't export the scalar variables to \f(CW%main::\fR but into the callers
namespace.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Process
.Sp
Added \fIget_Win32_IPC_HANDLE()\fR method for Win32::IPC compatibility.
.Sp
Added \s-1STILL_ACTIVE\s0 constant for \fIGetExitCode()\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIWin32::Process::Open()\fR now records the process \s-1ID\s0 correctly
for \fIGetProcessID()\fR.  It also creates handle now that can be
used with the \fIWait()\fR method.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Shortcut
.Sp
The \fISave()\fR function now calls \fIWin32::GetLongPathName()\fR on the filename
to make sure to use a fully qualified pathname.
.Sp
The \fISave()\fR will store the new filename as the 'File' property unless
the Shortcut object already has a 'File' property.

ActivePerl build 808 is still being compiled with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR option to maintain binary compatibility with earlier

Build 807 is based on Perl 5.8.1.  This is the first release of ActivePerl
based on this new maintenance release of Perl.  This release is meant for
use in production systems.  However, owing to the sheer volume of changes
between Perl 5.8.0 and 5.8.1 that have been incorporated, please be sure
to test it thoroughly in a non-critical environment before you upgrade
your production systems.

Only additional changes specific to ActivePerl are mentioned here.
.PP
\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl 5.8.1 has been incorporated.  See perl581delta for a list of changes.
.Sp
\&\fBImportant note:\fR The new \fIHash Randomisation\fR feature has been
disabled in ActivePerl because it is not compatible with Perl 5.8.0.
If we enabled this feature then some modules compiled with 5.8.0 would
not work correctly with 5.8.1 and most modules compiled with 5.8.1
would not work at all with Perl 5.8.0.  This would require maintaining
separate \s-1PPM\s0 module repositories for 5.8.0 and 5.8.1.
.Sp
To enable the \fIHash Randomisation\fR feature you must recompile
ActivePerl from source and remove the \f(CW\*(C`\-DNO_HASH_SEED\*(C'\fR definition
from the C compiler options.  In that case you must compile all \s-1CPAN\s0
modules yourself too because the \s-1PPM\s0 repository binaries will not be
compatible.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Windows 2003 Server is now officially supported.  The installer adds
entries to the \s-1IIS6\s0 \*(L"Web Services Extensions\*(R" list for both \*(L"Perl \s-1CGI\s0\*(R"
and \*(L"Perl \s-1ISAPI\s0\*(R".  Both are set to \*(L"Prohibited\*(R" by default and must
be explicitly changed to \*(L"Allow\*(R" in the \s-1IIS\s0 Manager.

\&\fIWin32::GetOSName()\fR detects the release version of Windows 2003
correctly.
.IP "\(bu" 8
ActiveState::Rx module has been included.  This module is necessary to
use the Rx Toolkit in ActiveState Visual Perl.  You must upgrade
Visual Perl to version 1.8.1 to use the Rx Toolkit with Perl 5.8.

It is now possible to install from a file \s-1URL\s0 while not being
connected to the internet.

\&\s-1PPM\s0 now works on Windows even when the Term::InKey module is
installed.
.PP
\&\fIPerl for \s-1ISAPI\s0\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 no longer uses line buffering for \s-1STDOUT\s0.  This is
especially important for running under \s-1IIS6\s0 which bypasses \s-1TCP/IP\s0
nagling and directly sends every packet individually.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 used to close all open file handles before shutting
down the Perl interpreter.  The intention was to prevent file handle
leaks from buggy Perl scripts while running inside the \s-1IIS\s0 process.
Unfortunately Perl may still execute \s-1END\s0 blocks or call \s-1DESTROY\s0
methods during final destruction and some file handles may get closed
twice in this scenario.
.Sp
This creates a race condition: the file handle may already have been
re-opened by a different thread before the second close happens.  Perl
then closes a file handle it doesn't own anymore.  This may cause a
different page request to fail.
.Sp
To avoid this race condition Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 will no longer try to
automatically close open file handles.  Therefore it is possible that
broken Perl applications will now start leaking file handles if they
don't close them correctly themselves.

authentication.  Previous versions of \s-1PPM\s0 3.0 only supported
proxy servers that did not require authentication.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 is now more robust in handling user-defined repository URLs.
For instance, URLs with a trailing slash no longer result in
fatal errors.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Support for \s-1ASPN\s0 Perl profiles has been much improved.  However,
at the time of this writing, the ActivePerl 5.8 repositories
do not yet support profiles.  This is expected to become available
shortly.
.IP "\(bu" 8
In previous versions of \s-1PPM\s0 3, incorrect search results from the
repository (such as package names that do not have corresponding
\&\s-1PPD\s0 files) could crash the \s-1PPM3\s0 client.  \s-1PPM\s0 now generates meaningful
error messages under these circumstances.

\&\fIBug Fixes and Changes\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
Several bug fixes and other improvements have been merged from the
Perl development track.  In particular, many of these fixes address
weaknesses in Unicode support.  See the ActivePerl source code diff
for the complete list of included changes.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Bugs in the Perl 5.8 integration of Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 and PerlScript
that resulted in failure to flush output correctly at the termination
of the script have been fixed.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, \fIsystem()\fR and backticks could return invalid status when
running under environments where the process has to handle Windows
messages.  PerlScript and Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 fall under this category.
The problem has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
On Windows, PerlScript and Perl for \s-1ISAPI\s0 were affected by a reentrancy
problem, which meant that recursive invocation of these two engines
could fail.  This problem has been corrected.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Tk and libwww-perl has been updated to their latest versions.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Win32::Shortcut no longer calls \fICoUninitialize()\fR within an \s-1END\s0 block.
This avoids random coredumps from this module when its \s-1DESTROY\s0 methods
happen to get called after the \s-1END\s0 block executes.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 v2 and v3 can now optionally generate \s-1HTML\s0 documentation when
installing packages if \s-1POD\s0 documentation is found in the package.
This is controlled by the rebuildhtml option in \s-1PPM\s0 v2 and the
rebuild-html option in \s-1PPM\s0 v3.

\&\fIWhat's new in the 800 Series\fR
.IP "\(bu" 8
This build corresponds to the Perl 5.8.0 source code release.
.IP "\(bu" 8
The 800 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 500 or 600 series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 500 or 600 series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to \s-1PPM\s0 packages that may have been
built for 500 or 600 series builds.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.8.0 release
are documented in perl58delta.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Support has been enabled for large file access on all platforms,
meaning that file manipulation facilities within perl can cope with
files larger than 2GB or 4GB.
.IP "\(bu" 8
Many new modules are included as a standard part of perl 5.8.0.  See
\&\*(L"Modules and Pragmata\*(R" in perl58delta for a detailed list.
In addition, the Data::Dump module is now included with ActivePerl.
Many other modules have been updated to their latest versions.
.IP "\(bu" 8
\&\s-1PPM\s0 v3 is now included as the default \f(CW\*(C`ppm\*(C'\fR executable.  \s-1PPM\s0 v2
continues to be available, and can be executed as \f(CW\*(C`ppm2\*(C'\fR.
