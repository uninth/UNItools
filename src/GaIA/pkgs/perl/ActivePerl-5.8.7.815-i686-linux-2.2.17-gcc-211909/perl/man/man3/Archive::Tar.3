.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Archive::Tar provides an object oriented mechanism for handling tar
files.  It provides class methods for quick and easy files handling
while also allowing for the creation of tar file objects for custom
manipulation.  If you have the IO::Zlib module installed,
Archive::Tar will also support compressed or gzipped tar files.
.PP
An object of class Archive::Tar represents a .tar(.gz) archive full
of files and things.
.SH "Object Methods"
.IX Header "Object Methods"
.ie n .Sh "Archive::Tar\->new( [$file, $compressed] )"
.el .Sh "Archive::Tar\->new( [$file, \f(CW$compressed\fP] )"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Tar->new( [$file, $compressed] )"
Returns a new Tar object. If given any arguments, \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR calls the
\&\f(CW\*(C`read()\*(C'\fR method automatically, passing on the arguments provided to
the \f(CW\*(C`read()\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR is invoked with arguments and the \f(CW\*(C`read()\*(C'\fR method fails
for any reason, \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR returns undef.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->read ( $filename\fP|$handle, \f(CW$compressed, {opt => 'val'} )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->read ( \f(CW$filename\fP|$handle, \f(CW$compressed\fP, {opt => 'val'} )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->read ( $filename|$handle, $compressed, {opt => 'val'} )"
Read the given tar file into memory.
The first argument can either be the name of a file or a reference to
an already open filehandle (or an IO::Zlib object if it's compressed)
The second argument indicates whether the file referenced by the first
argument is compressed.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR will \fIreplace\fR any previous content in \f(CW$tar\fR!
.PP
The second argument may be considered optional if IO::Zlib is
installed, since it will transparently Do The Right Thing.
Archive::Tar will warn if you try to pass a compressed file if
IO::Zlib is not available and simply return.
.PP
The third argument can be a hash reference with options. Note that
all options are case\-sensitive.
.IP "limit" 4
.IX Item "limit"
Do not read more than \f(CW\*(C`limit\*(C'\fR files. This is useful if you have
very big archives, and are only interested in the first few files.
.IP "extract" 4
.IX Item "extract"
If set to true, immediately extract entries when reading them. This
gives you the same memory break as the \f(CW\*(C`extract_archive\*(C'\fR function.
Note however that entries will not be read into memory, but written
straight to disk.
.PP
All files are stored internally as \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR objects.
Please consult the Archive::Tar::File documentation for details.
.PP
Returns the number of files read in scalar context, and a list of
\&\f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR objects in list context.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->contains_file( $filename )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->contains_file( \f(CW$filename\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->contains_file( $filename )"
Check if the archive contains a certain file.
It will return true if the file is in the archive, false otherwise.
.PP
Note however, that this function does an exact match using \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR
on the full path. So it cannot compensate for case-insensitive file\-
systems or compare 2 paths to see if they would point to the same
underlying file.
.Sh "$tar\->extract( [@filenames] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->extract( [@filenames] )"
Write files whose names are equivalent to any of the names in
\&\f(CW@filenames\fR to disk, creating subdirectories as necessary. This
might not work too well under \s-1VMS\s0.
Under MacPerl, the file's modification time will be converted to the
MacOS zero of time, and appropriate conversions will be done to the
path.  However, the length of each element of the path is not
inspected to see whether it's longer than MacOS currently allows (32
characters).
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`extract\*(C'\fR is called without a list of file names, the entire
contents of the archive are extracted.
.PP
Returns a list of filenames extracted.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->extract_file( $file, [$extract_path] )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->extract_file( \f(CW$file\fP, [$extract_path] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->extract_file( $file, [$extract_path] )"
Write an entry, whose name is equivalent to the file name provided to
disk. Optionally takes a second parameter, which is the full (unix)
path (including filename) the entry will be written to.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $tar->extract_file( 'name/in/archive', 'name/i/want/to/give/it' );
.Ve
.PP
Returns true on success, false on failure.
.Sh "$tar\->list_files( [\e@properties] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->list_files( [@properties] )"
Returns a list of the names of all the files in the archive.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`list_files()\*(C'\fR is passed an array reference as its first argument
it returns a list of hash references containing the requested
properties of each file.  The following list of properties is
supported: name, size, mtime (last modified date), mode, uid, gid,
linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor, prefix.
.PP
Passing an array reference containing only one element, 'name', is
special cased to return a list of names rather than a list of hash
references, making it equivalent to calling \f(CW\*(C`list_files\*(C'\fR without
arguments.
.Sh "$tar\->get_files( [@filenames] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->get_files( [@filenames] )"
Returns the \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR objects matching the filenames
provided. If no filename list was passed, all \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR
objects in the current Tar object are returned.
.PP
Please refer to the \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR documentation on how to
handle these objects.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->get_content( $file )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->get_content( \f(CW$file\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->get_content( $file )"
Return the content of the named file.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->replace_content( $file\fP, \f(CW$content )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->replace_content( \f(CW$file\fP, \f(CW$content\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->replace_content( $file, $content )"
Make the string \f(CW$content\fR be the content for the file named \f(CW$file\fR.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->rename( $file\fP, \f(CW$new_name )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->rename( \f(CW$file\fP, \f(CW$new_name\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->rename( $file, $new_name )"
Rename the file of the in-memory archive to \f(CW$new_name\fR.
.PP
Note that you must specify a Unix path for \f(CW$new_name\fR, since per tar
standard, all files in the archive must be Unix paths.
.PP
Returns true on success and false on failure.
.Sh "$tar\->remove (@filenamelist)"
.IX Subsection "$tar->remove (@filenamelist)"
Removes any entries with names matching any of the given filenames
from the in-memory archive. Returns a list of \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR
objects that remain.
.Sh "$tar\->clear"
.IX Subsection "$tar->clear"
\&\f(CW\*(C`clear\*(C'\fR clears the current in-memory archive. This effectively gives
you a 'blank' object, ready to be filled again. Note that \f(CW\*(C`clear\*(C'\fR
only has effect on the object, not the underlying tarfile.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->write ( [$file, $compressed\fP, \f(CW$prefix] )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->write ( [$file, \f(CW$compressed\fP, \f(CW$prefix\fP] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->write ( [$file, $compressed, $prefix] )"
Write the in-memory archive to disk.  The first argument can either
be the name of a file or a reference to an already open filehandle (a
\&\s-1GLOB\s0 reference). If the second argument is true, the module will use
IO::Zlib to write the file in a compressed format.  If IO::Zlib is
not available, the \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR method will fail and return.
.PP
Note that when you pass in a filehandle, the compression argument
is ignored, as all files are printed verbatim to your filehandle.
If you wish to enable compression with filehandles, use an
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR filehandle instead.
.PP
Specific levels of compression can be chosen by passing the values 2
through 9 as the second parameter.
.PP
The third argument is an optional prefix. All files will be tucked
away in the directory you specify as prefix. So if you have files
\&'a' and 'b' in your archive, and you specify 'foo' as prefix, they
will be written to the archive as 'foo/a' and 'foo/b'.
.PP
If no arguments are given, \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR returns the entire formatted
archive as a string, which could be useful if you'd like to stuff the
archive into a socket or a pipe to gzip or something.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->add_files( @filenamelist )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->add_files( \f(CW@filenamelist\fP )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->add_files( @filenamelist )"
Takes a list of filenames and adds them to the in-memory archive.
.PP
The path to the file is automatically converted to a Unix like
equivalent for use in the archive, and, if on MacOS, the file's
modification time is converted from the MacOS epoch to the Unix epoch.
So tar archives created on MacOS with \fBArchive::Tar\fR can be read
both with \fItar\fR on Unix and applications like \fIsuntar\fR or
\&\fIStuffit Expander\fR on MacOS.
.PP
Be aware that the file's type/creator and resource fork will be lost,
which is usually what you want in cross-platform archives.
.PP
Returns a list of \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR objects that were just added.
.ie n .Sh "$tar\->add_data ( $filename\fP, \f(CW$data, [$opthashref] )"
.el .Sh "$tar\->add_data ( \f(CW$filename\fP, \f(CW$data\fP, [$opthashref] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->add_data ( $filename, $data, [$opthashref] )"
Takes a filename, a scalar full of data and optionally a reference to
a hash with specific options.
.PP
Will add a file to the in-memory archive, with name \f(CW$filename\fR and
content \f(CW$data\fR. Specific properties can be set using \f(CW$opthashref\fR.
The following list of properties is supported: name, size, mtime
(last modified date), mode, uid, gid, linkname, uname, gname,
devmajor, devminor, prefix.  (On MacOS, the file's path and
modification times are converted to Unix equivalents.)
.PP
Returns the \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar::File\*(C'\fR object that was just added, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on failure.
.Sh "$tar\->error( [$BOOL] )"
.IX Subsection "$tar->error( [$BOOL] )"
Returns the current errorstring (usually, the last error reported).
If a true value was specified, it will give the \f(CW\*(C`Carp::longmess\*(C'\fR
equivalent of the error, in effect giving you a stacktrace.
.PP
For backwards compatibility, this error is also available as
\&\f(CW$Archive::Tar::error\fR although it is much recommended you use the
method call instead.
.ie n .Sh "$bool = $tar\->has_io_string"
.el .Sh "$bool = \f(CW$tar\fP\->has_io_string"
.IX Subsection "$bool = $tar->has_io_string"
Returns true if we currently have \f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR support loaded.
.PP
Either \f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR support is needed to support writing 
stringified archives. Currently, \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR is the preferred method, if
available.
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`GLOBAL VARIABLES\*(C'\fR section to see how to change this preference.
.ie n .Sh "$bool = $tar\->has_perlio"
.el .Sh "$bool = \f(CW$tar\fP\->has_perlio"
.IX Subsection "$bool = $tar->has_perlio"
Returns true if we currently have \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR support loaded.
.PP
This requires \f(CW\*(C`perl\-5.8\*(C'\fR or higher, compiled with \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR 
.PP
Either \f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR support is needed to support writing 
stringified archives. Currently, \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR is the preferred method, if
available.
.PP
See the \f(CW\*(C`GLOBAL VARIABLES\*(C'\fR section to see how to change this preference.
.SH "Class Methods"
.IX Header "Class Methods"
.ie n .Sh "Archive::Tar\->create_archive($file, $compression\fP, \f(CW@filelist)"
.el .Sh "Archive::Tar\->create_archive($file, \f(CW$compression\fP, \f(CW@filelist\fP)"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Tar->create_archive($file, $compression, @filelist)"
Creates a tar file from the list of files provided.  The first
argument can either be the name of the tar file to create or a
reference to an open file handle (e.g. a \s-1GLOB\s0 reference).
.PP
The second argument specifies the level of compression to be used, if
any.  Compression of tar files requires the installation of the
IO::Zlib module.  Specific levels of compression may be
requested by passing a value between 2 and 9 as the second argument.
Any other value evaluating as true will result in the default
compression level being used.
.PP
Note that when you pass in a filehandle, the compression argument
is ignored, as all files are printed verbatim to your filehandle.
If you wish to enable compression with filehandles, use an
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR filehandle instead.
.PP
The remaining arguments list the files to be included in the tar file.
These files must all exist. Any files which don't exist or can't be
read are silently ignored.
.PP
If the archive creation fails for any reason, \f(CW\*(C`create_archive\*(C'\fR will
return false. Please use the \f(CW\*(C`error\*(C'\fR method to find the cause of the
failure.
.PP
Note that this method does not write \f(CW\*(C`on the fly\*(C'\fR as it were; it
still reads all the files into memory before writing out the archive.
Consult the \s-1FAQ\s0 below if this is a problem.
.ie n .Sh "Archive::Tar\->list_archive ($file, $compressed, [\e@properties])"
.el .Sh "Archive::Tar\->list_archive ($file, \f(CW$compressed\fP, [\e@properties])"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Tar->list_archive ($file, $compressed, [@properties])"
Returns a list of the names of all the files in the archive.  The
first argument can either be the name of the tar file to list or a
reference to an open file handle (e.g. a \s-1GLOB\s0 reference).
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`list_archive()\*(C'\fR is passed an array reference as its third
argument it returns a list of hash references containing the requested
properties of each file.  The following list of properties is
supported: name, size, mtime (last modified date), mode, uid, gid,
linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor, prefix.
.PP
Passing an array reference containing only one element, 'name', is
special cased to return a list of names rather than a list of hash
references.
.ie n .Sh "Archive::Tar\->extract_archive ($file, $gzip)"
.el .Sh "Archive::Tar\->extract_archive ($file, \f(CW$gzip\fP)"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Tar->extract_archive ($file, $gzip)"
Extracts the contents of the tar file.  The first argument can either
be the name of the tar file to create or a reference to an open file
handle (e.g. a \s-1GLOB\s0 reference).  All relative paths in the tar file will
be created underneath the current working directory.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`extract_archive\*(C'\fR will return a list of files it extracted.
If the archive extraction fails for any reason, \f(CW\*(C`extract_archive\*(C'\fR
will return false.  Please use the \f(CW\*(C`error\*(C'\fR method to find the cause
of the failure.
.Sh "Archive::Tar\->can_handle_compressed_files"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Tar->can_handle_compressed_files"
A simple checking routine, which will return true if \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR
is able to uncompress compressed archives on the fly with \f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR,
or false if \f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR is not installed.
.PP
You can use this as a shortcut to determine whether \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR
will do what you think before passing compressed archives to its
\&\f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR method.
.SH "GLOBAL VARIABLES"
.IX Header "GLOBAL VARIABLES"
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::FOLLOW_SYMLINK"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::FOLLOW_SYMLINK"
Set this variable to \f(CW1\fR to make \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR effectively make a
copy of the file when extracting. Default is \f(CW0\fR, which
means the symlink stays intact. Of course, you will have to pack the
file linked to as well.
.PP
This option is checked when you write out the tarfile using \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`create_archive\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This works just like \f(CW\*(C`/bin/tar\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-h\*(C'\fR option.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::CHOWN"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::CHOWN"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR will try to \f(CW\*(C`chown\*(C'\fR your files if it is
able to. In some cases, this may not be desired. In that case, set
this variable to \f(CW0\fR to disable \f(CW\*(C`chown\*(C'\fR\-ing, even if it were
possible.
.PP
The default is \f(CW1\fR.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::CHMOD"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::CHMOD"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR will try to \f(CW\*(C`chmod\*(C'\fR your files to
whatever mode was specified for the particular file in the archive.
In some cases, this may not be desired. In that case, set this
variable to \f(CW0\fR to disable \f(CW\*(C`chmod\*(C'\fR\-ing.
.PP
The default is \f(CW1\fR.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX"
By default, \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR will try to put paths that are over
100 characters in the \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR field of your tar header. However,
some older tar programs do not implement this spec. To retain
compatibility with these older versions, you can set the
\&\f(CW$DO_NOT_USE_PREFIX\fR variable to a true value, and \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR
will use an alternate way of dealing with paths over 100 characters
by using the \f(CW\*(C`GNU Extended Header\*(C'\fR feature.
.PP
The default is \f(CW0\fR.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::DEBUG"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::DEBUG"
Set this variable to \f(CW1\fR to always get the \f(CW\*(C`Carp::longmess\*(C'\fR output
of the warnings, instead of the regular \f(CW\*(C`carp\*(C'\fR. This is the same
message you would get by doing:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $tar->error(1);
.Ve
.PP
Defaults to \f(CW0\fR.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::WARN"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::WARN"
Set this variable to \f(CW0\fR if you do not want any warnings printed.
Personally I recommend against doing this, but people asked for the
option. Also, be advised that this is of course not threadsafe.
.PP
Defaults to \f(CW1\fR.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::error"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::error"
Holds the last reported error. Kept for historical reasons, but its
use is very much discouraged. Use the \f(CW\*(C`error()\*(C'\fR method instead:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    warn $tar->error unless $tar->extract;
.Ve
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::HAS_PERLIO"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::HAS_PERLIO"
This variable holds a boolean indicating if we currently have 
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR support loaded. This will be enabled for any perl
greater than \f(CW5.8\fR compiled with \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR. 
.PP
If you feel strongly about disabling it, set this variable to
\&\f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR. Note that you will then need \f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR installed
to support writing stringified archives.
.PP
Don't change this variable unless you \fBreally\fR know what you're
doing.
.Sh "$Archive::Tar::HAS_IO_STRING"
.IX Subsection "$Archive::Tar::HAS_IO_STRING"
This variable holds a boolean indicating if we currently have 
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR support loaded. This will be enabled for any perl
that has a loadable \f(CW\*(C`IO::String\*(C'\fR module.
.PP
If you feel strongly about disabling it, set this variable to
\&\f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR. Note that you will then need \f(CW\*(C`perlio\*(C'\fR support from
your perl to be able to  write stringified archives.
.PP
Don't change this variable unless you \fBreally\fR know what you're
doing.
.SH "FAQ"
.IX Header "FAQ"
.IP "What's the minimum perl version required to run Archive::Tar?" 4
.IX Item "What's the minimum perl version required to run Archive::Tar?"
You will need perl version 5.005_03 or newer.
.IP "Isn't Archive::Tar slow?" 4
.IX Item "Isn't Archive::Tar slow?"
Yes it is. It's pure perl, so it's a lot slower then your \f(CW\*(C`/bin/tar\*(C'\fR
However, it's very portable. If speed is an issue, consider using
\&\f(CW\*(C`/bin/tar\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "Isn't Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?" 4
.IX Item "Isn't Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?"
Yes it is, see previous answer. Since \f(CW\*(C`Compress::Zlib\*(C'\fR and therefore
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR doesn't support \f(CW\*(C`seek\*(C'\fR on their filehandles, there is little
choice but to read the archive into memory.
This is ok if you want to do in-memory manipulation of the archive.
If you just want to extract, use the \f(CW\*(C`extract_archive\*(C'\fR class method
instead. It will optimize and write to disk immediately.
.IP "Can't you lazy-load data instead?" 4
.IX Item "Can't you lazy-load data instead?"
No, not easily. See previous question.
.IP "How much memory will an X kb tar file need?" 4
.IX Item "How much memory will an X kb tar file need?"
Probably more than X kb, since it will all be read into memory. If
this is a problem, and you don't need to do in memory manipulation
of the archive, consider using \f(CW\*(C`/bin/tar\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "What do you do with unsupported filetypes in an archive?" 4
.IX Item "What do you do with unsupported filetypes in an archive?"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Unix\*(C'\fR has a few filetypes that aren't supported on other platforms,
like \f(CW\*(C`Win32\*(C'\fR. If we encounter a \f(CW\*(C`hardlink\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`symlink\*(C'\fR we'll just
try to make a copy of the original file, rather than throwing an error.
.Sp
This does require you to read the entire archive in to memory first,
since otherwise we wouldn't know what data to fill the copy with.
(This means that you cannot use the class methods on archives that
have incompatible filetypes and still expect things to work).
.Sp
For other filetypes, like \f(CW\*(C`chardevs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`blockdevs\*(C'\fR we'll warn that
the extraction of this particular item didn't work.
.IP "How do I access .tar.Z files?" 4
.IX Item "How do I access .tar.Z files?"
The \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR module can optionally use \f(CW\*(C`Compress::Zlib\*(C'\fR (via
the \f(CW\*(C`IO::Zlib\*(C'\fR module) to access tar files that have been compressed
with \f(CW\*(C`gzip\*(C'\fR. Unfortunately tar files compressed with the Unix \f(CW\*(C`compress\*(C'\fR
utility cannot be read by \f(CW\*(C`Compress::Zlib\*(C'\fR and so cannot be directly
accesses by \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`uncompress\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`gunzip\*(C'\fR programs are available, you can use
one of these workarounds to read \f(CW\*(C`.tar.Z\*(C'\fR files from \f(CW\*(C`Archive::Tar\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Firstly with \f(CW\*(C`uncompress\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Archive::Tar;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    open F, "uncompress -c $filename |";
\&    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
\&    ...
.Ve
.Sp
and this with \f(CW\*(C`gunzip\*(C'\fR
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    use Archive::Tar;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    open F, "gunzip -c $filename |";
\&    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new(*F);
\&    ...
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, if the \f(CW\*(C`compress\*(C'\fR program is available, you can use this to
write a \f(CW\*(C`.tar.Z\*(C'\fR file
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    use Archive::Tar;
\&    use IO::File;
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    my $fh = new IO::File "| compress -c >$filename";
\&    my $tar = Archive::Tar->new();
\&    ...
\&    $tar->write($fh);
\&    $fh->close ;
