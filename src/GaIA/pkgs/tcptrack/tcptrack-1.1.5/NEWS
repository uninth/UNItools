 * tcptrack 1.1.2 is available in Debian unstable. 1.1.1 is also available in
   testing (thanks to Leo Costela).


==== Jun 3, 2004 - 1.1.2 released ==========================================

 tcptrack 1.1.2 is now available (source packages). The following changes
 were made from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2:

 * Fixed assertion an assertion failure (in IPv4Packet.cc) bug.
 * tcptrack can now run on interfaces with no IPv4 addresses (ie, stealth
   interfaces).
 * Fixed a few crashes and assertion failures on Mac OSX and FreeBSD caused
   by missing pthread_*_init calls. Thanks to Chuck Schied for the patch.
 * Added a timeout for connections in the CLOSING state. Connections may get
   stuck in that state due to dropped packets, timeouts by the peers, or
   there may be a bug in the TCPConnection state machine code that I haven't
   found yet.
 * ChangeLog is now a regular ChangeLog, not a development log. The contents
   of this file were previously in the NEWS file. NEWS will now contain the
   same stuff that's on the web page. The development log was removed since
   it was out of date (and as far as I know, not used by anyone).
