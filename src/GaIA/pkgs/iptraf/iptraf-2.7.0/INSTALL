INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IPTRAF 2.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS SECTION IN THE README.  IPTRAF 2
REQUIRES LINUX 2.2 OR LATER.

The iptraf-2.7.0.tar.gz file no longer contains precompiled executable
programs, only source code.  To compile and install, just change to the
iptraf-2.7.0 top-level directory and type:

	./Setup

This will automatically compile and install the software.

The traditional

	cd src
	make clean
	make
	make install

can still be used.

Precompiled binaries are available in the iptraf-2.7.0.i386.bin.tar.gz
file.  This contains no source code and is expected to run on Intel x86
Linux with the GNU C Library 2.1 or later.

UPGRADING FROM 2.1 or 2.4

There have been filter file format changes but no need to redefine existing
filters.  IPTraf 2.5 will not use the saved filters from versions 2.1 to 2.4.
so if you had some applied TCP and UDP filters, just reapply them.

Also verify the settings for your ARP, RARP, and non-IP filter toggles,
and define as appropriate your miscellaneous IP filters.

UPGRADING FROM 2.0.x or 1.4.x

IPTraf 1.4.x and 2.0.x had a filename parsing bug that caused the filter
data files to be placed in the wrong directory with the wrong names.  This
version corrects it.  If you're using TCP or UDP filters, perform a "make
upgrade" before running the program.  This step will place the filter data
files in the correct place with the right names.

DEALING WITH "ERROR OPENING TERMINAL"

The precompiled executable program comes linked with ncurses 4.2.  ncurses
4.2 needs to determine your terminal capabilities from the terminfo
database in /usr/share/terminfo.  If the supplied program fails with
"Error opening terminal", check this directory.  If it doesn't exist, your
terminfo database may be somewhere else.  To override the default terminfo
search path, you can use the TERMINFO environment variable.  Supposing
your terminfo is in /usr/lib/terminfo (typical for Slackware
distributions)

	TERMINFO=/usr/lib/terminfo
	export TERMINFO

You may want to place these commands in your login initialization files
(/etc/profile or ~/.profile for sh/bash).

You can also create a symbolic link /usr/share/terminfo to point to
your existing terminfo database.  For example, given the same conditions
above:

	ln -s /usr/lib/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo

Or, as an alternative, you can simply recompile your program to use your
ncurses installation.  Be sure you have at least ncurses 1.9.9e.  See
section on recompiling below.

See the README file and the manual for more information.
