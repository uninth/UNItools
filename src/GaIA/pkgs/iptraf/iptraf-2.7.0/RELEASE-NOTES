BUG FIXES
---------

IPTraf 2.6.1 fixes a minor bug where stale lock files were not removed
properly if IPTraf did not start due to an improper terminal size.
See the CHANGES file for more details.

A fairly significant bug in the 2.6 series occurs on multiple-interface
machines where the detailed interface statistics did not filter the
packets to allow only packets on the selected interface.  This has quite
an impact on multiple-interface systems, but even single-interface systems
can result in inaccuracy if the loopback interface had traffic.  This has
been fixed in 2.7.0, together with the other facilities with the proper 
interface name comparisons.  

IPTraf 2.7.0 also corrects a minor bug where lock files were not properly
removed if IPTraf failed with an insufficient terminal size error.


ADDITIONAL NETWORK INTERFACE SUPPORT
------------------------------------

IPTraf 2.7 supports additional DVB interface types (sm2*, sm3*, penta*).  
wlan and wvlan (wireless Ethernet) interface support has also been added.


DOCUMENTATION FORMAT CHANGES
----------------------------

The included HTML manual has now been generated from DocBook SGML sources, 
and is now organized more like the familiar documents from the Linux 
Documentation project (http://www.tldp.org), with each chapter and section
in its own easy-to-read small HTML page.  The SGML template is included
also has to be processed with the Makefile for the proper version numbers
to be inserted.

The captured screenshots have now been saved to PNG format.  This saves
disk space without sacrificing the quality of the shots, and I avoid the
possibility of patent infringement.  However the DocBook icons (e.g.  
Note, Tip, etc.) came with DocBook and are still in GIF format.  They are
just distributed as they come.

Please view the README file in the Documentation/ directory for more 
information.

FILE FORMATS
------------

There are no file format changes from 2.5 to 2.7 and the existing
2.5-format files can be used. See the INSTALL file for instructions on
upgrading from earlier versions.

(The following information was originally written for the IPTraf 2.6
release notes but in included here for completeness.)

For programmers: CODE CHANGES in IPTraf 2.6
-------------------------------------------

Some redundant code for the user interface has been reduced.  Reusable
user interface components (forms, menus, and listboxes) have been moved to
a separate directory outside of the main source directory and compiled as
a library.  This will allow for better code reuse in future applications
as well as other applications interested programmers may develop.

As of now this library has not been formally named, but as it stands, is
still part of the IPTraf distribution and still under the GNU General
Public License.  See the README file in the support/ directory for more
information.
