VERSION
       1.0.0 (21-10-1997)

DESCRIPTION
       SMTPclient is a minimal SMTP client that takes an email message body
       and passes it on to a SMTP server (default is the MTA on the local
       host). Since it is completely self-supporting, it is especially
       suitable for use in restricted environments.

       A typical usage is as a MTA emulating program on a dedicated webserver.
       There it is usually called from within a CGI program to receive a mail
       (constructed by the CGI program out of a HTML form) and to forward it
       to the actual mailserver.

OPTIONS
       -s, --subject=STR
	   Specifies the Subject: header. This gives the message a title.
	   Default is no subject.

       -f, --from=ADDR
	   Specifies the From: address header. This is the logical senders
	   address.  Default is ‘‘daemon’’, which is probably wrong.

       -r, --reply-to=ADDR
	   Specifies the Reply-To: address header. This is where replies
	   should be send to. Default is no such header.

       -e, --errors-to=ADDR
	   Specifies the Errors-To: address header. This is where delivery
	   problems should be reported. Default is no such header.

       -c, --carbon-copy=ADDR
	   Specifies the Cc: address header. This can contain one or more
	   addresses (seperated by comma) to which one copy of the message is
	   send to. Default is no such header.

       -S, --smtp-host=HOST
	   Specifies the name or IP-address of the SMTP host to connect to.
	   This is the host where the MTA is running to which the message is
	   forwarded. By default, the mail is send to the SMTP daemon on
	   localhost or to the host specified in the environment-variable
	   SMTPSERVER if exists.

       -P, --smtp-port=NUM
	   Specifies the port of the SMTP host to connect to. Default is port
	   25 (smtp).

       -M, --mime-encode
	   Use MIME-style translation to quoted-printable (base 16).

       -L, --use-syslog
	   Log errors to system’s syslog facility instead of stderr.

       -v, --verbose
	   Turn on verbose logging to stdout.

       -V, --version
	   Display the program version.

       -h, --help
	   Display the usage page.

RESULTS
       The program terminates with a non-zero exit status in case of errors.
